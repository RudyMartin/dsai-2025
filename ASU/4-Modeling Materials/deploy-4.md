# ðŸ“š How to Put a Trained AI Model on Your ESP32-S3 (Step-by-Step)

### 1. **Save your trained model to your computer**
- If you trained your model on **Roboflow**:
  - Go to your Roboflow project page.
  - Click **"Export"**.
  - Choose **"TensorFlow Lite"** as the format.
  - Download the `.tflite` file to your computer.  
    *(It should be a small file â€” maybe 100 to 200 KB.)*

- If you trained your model on **Google Colab**:
  - Save the model as `.tflite` in your Colab notebook.
  - Then **download** the `.tflite` file to your computer by clicking it in the side panel.

### 2. **Copy the model file onto a microSD card**
- Take a **microSD card** and put it into a **USB card reader**.
- Plug the card reader into your computer.
- Open the microSD folder.
- **Drag and drop** the `.tflite` model file onto the microSD card.  
  (You can put it in the main folder â€” no need for subfolders.)

- **Eject** the microSD card safely when you are done.

### 3. **Insert the microSD card into your ESP32-S3 setup**
- Carefully put the microSD card into the **microSD adapter** that's wired to your ESP32-S3.
- Make sure it clicks in securely.

---

### 4. **Mount (open) the SD card in your code**
- In your Arduino code (or PlatformIO), add commands to **mount** the SD card.
- Example:
  ```cpp
  if (!SD.begin(CS_PIN)) {
    Serial.println("Card Mount Failed");
    return;
  }
  ```
- This step **opens the SD card** so the ESP32 can find the model file.

---

### 5. **Read the model file into memory**
- In your code, **open** the `.tflite` file from the SD card.
- Load it into a **memory buffer**.
- Example:
  ```cpp
  File modelFile = SD.open("/your_model.tflite");
  modelFile.readBytes((char*)modelData, modelFile.size());
  ```
- Now the model is **loaded** and ready to use!

---

### 6. **Run the model on the ESP32-S3**
- Use **TensorFlow Lite Micro** (TFLM) to **run inferences** (make predictions) with the model.
- Set up the interpreter with the loaded model.
- Run a test to make sure it works!
