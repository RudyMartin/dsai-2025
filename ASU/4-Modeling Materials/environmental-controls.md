## üîß GENERAL TIPS FOR ENVIRONMENTAL CONTROLS
- Use **controlled enclosures** (e.g., plastic tubs, fish tanks) with access points.
- Integrate **actuators** (fans, heaters, lamps) to modify the environment.
- Log and visualize data using tools like **MicroPython + MQTT**, **ESPHome + Home Assistant**, or **Arduino IDE + Serial Plotter**.

## üå°Ô∏è TEMPERATURE EXPERIMENTS
### Active Control:
- **Mini heater or hair dryer** (watch safety) to simulate heat waves.
- **Peltier modules** or ice packs to cool the space.

### Ideas:
- Diurnal cycle simulation: Rise/fall of temperature across a day.
- Alert system for overheating electronics (e.g., mimic Mars rover conditions).
- Temperature-triggered response: Turn on fan or buzzer above a threshold.

## üíß HUMIDITY EXPERIMENTS
### Active Control:
- **Ultrasonic humidifier** for high humidity (easy to control).
- **Silica gel**, rice, or mini dehumidifiers to drop humidity.
  
### Ideas:
- Foggy vs. dry room detection.
- Simulate environments like a **tropical jungle vs. desert**.
- Trigger warnings for mold-prone areas.

## üí° LIGHT EXPERIMENTS
### Active Control:
- LED panels with adjustable brightness or color temperature.
- Covered box with slit to simulate sunrise/sunset.

### Ideas:
- Day/night cycle for plant growth.
- Alert system when light drops suddenly (e.g., power outage).
- Light-seeking robot or solar optimization simulation.

## üß™ COMBINED EXPERIMENTS (INTEGRATED SIMULATIONS)
- **Weather Station**: Log and predict comfort index or dew point.
- **Greenhouse Monitor**: Combine light + humidity + temperature to optimize plant growth.
- **AI-powered Environmental Classifier**: Train a model to classify "Desert," "Rainforest," "Nighttime," etc., from sensor input.
- **NASA Simulation**: Mimic conditions of Mars, Moon base, or inside a spaceship using artificial controls.
