# 🌌 From Space Missions to Skill Missions
### Why Artemis Still Matters — and Why Labs Took the Lead

This camp began as a **space mission simulation**, inspired by NASA's Artemis program. Teams like **Nova**, **Vega**, and **Orion** were meant to simulate communication, sensing, and coordination aboard a futuristic space deck.

But as we refined the experience, we learned something important:

> 💡 The real "mission" isn’t to *pretend* to be astronauts — it’s to *become* AI builders, problem solvers, and system thinkers.

## ✅ What Stayed

- The **space themes** are still here — guiding each day's mission topic:
  - *Day 1: See the World (Object Detection)*
  - *Day 2: Make a Move (Classification + Action)*
  - *Day 3: Remember and Decide (Routing + Memory)*
  - *Day 4: React to the Environment (Sensors + Logic)*
  - *Day 5: Act Together (Multi-Agent Systems)*

- The **team names** (Nova, Vega, Orion) still exist — now matched to types of systems:
  - **Nova** = Vision & Object Detection
  - **Vega** = Sensors & Local Intelligence
  - **Orion** = Data Coordination & Forecasting

## 🧪 What Changed

- We now lead with **hands-on Labs** — not roleplay
- Each lab is a real skill-builder in:
  - Python and Chatbots
  - Servo control
  - Sensor monitoring
  - TinyML and Object Classification
  - Logging, dashboards, coordination

- Capstone projects **tie these labs together** into a mission-style final build

## 🧭 Summary: Labs are the Journey, Space is the Story

We use Artemis **not as a literal simulation**, but as a metaphor:
- The story keeps it fun and immersive 🚀
- The labs make it real and powerful 🧠

> “The space deck is cool… but getting the servo to rotate based on a model’s prediction? That’s the real magic.”
