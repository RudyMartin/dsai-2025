## 🎓 **2025 AI Mission Camp – Higher Education Overview**

### 🎯 Core Educational Objectives:
To **immerse high school students (Grades 10–12)** in a structured, team-based simulation that builds real-world AI, engineering, and communication skills under the narrative of a **space mission simulation**.

---

## 🧠 **Key Skill Sets Students Develop**

### 🧪 Applied AI + Modeling
- **Object Detection with Roboflow**
  - Image classification, dataset collection, training
- **Confidence Thresholding**
  - Understanding model certainty, rejecting bad predictions
- **Model Evaluation**
  - Confusion matrix, accuracy, and reflection loops

### 🔧 Embedded Systems & Edge Computing
- **ESP32-S3 & Raspberry Pi Programming**
  - Microcontroller and Pi-based inference pipelines
- **Sensor Integration**
  - Light, temperature, proximity sensing
- **Real-Time Actuation**
  - Controlling servos and visual indicators from logic

### 🧬 Systems Thinking + Simulation Design
- **Rule-Based System Enforcement**
  - Flight rules, environmental gating, team sync
- **Data Manifest Design**
  - Timestamped logs, message syncs, forecasting
- **Failure Mode Discovery**
  - Debugging as part of the narrative loop

### 📡 Communication, Logging, and Data Storytelling
- **Mission Data Officer Role**
  - Tracking logs, summarizing outcomes, supporting system audit
- **Team Logbook Presentation**
  - Daily slides reflecting what worked, what failed, and next steps
- **Oral + Visual Presentation**
  - Communicating AI results and system logic to non-technical audiences

### 👾 Robotics + LEGO Engineering
- **LEGO Mindstorms/NXT Integration**
  - Physical builds linked to AI outputs
- **Servo-based sorting, alert flags, and interactive decks**

### 🌐 Systems Integration + Collaboration
- **NAS File Sync / Local Network Sharing**
  - Autonomous collaboration across “decks” via router
- **Proximity Sensors & Alerts**
  - Simulating real-time system interaction

## 🌌 Simulation Context: A Space Mission

> Students are told:  
> “You're building tech for a space mission. You’ve got 4 hours of battery, no internet, and your AI must work at the edge.”

- 3 Mission Tracks: Nova (AI detection), Vega (Sensor control), Orion (System integration + forecasting)
- Each team plays a real-world role that maps to **interdisciplinary STEM careers**
