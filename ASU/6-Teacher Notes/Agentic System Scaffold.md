|         |                                           | Learn: Servo control, camera test, basic Arduino sketching                       |
| **2**   | 🎯 Sort by Sight                          | Detect color or object class and send to correct bin using fixed “if/else” rules |
|         |                                           | Learn: Image classification basics, decision logic, intro to `if`, `else if`     |
| **3**   | 🧠 Make Smarter Decisions (Routing Agent) | Add memory or counters. E.g., send food to Deck B if Deck C is full              |
|         |                                           | Learn: Stateful logic, variables, conditional re-routing, sensors + memory       |
| **4**   | 🌡 React to the Environment               | Use sensors to avoid danger zones (e.g., heat or low light)                      |
|         |                                           | Learn: Environmental sensors (temp, humidity, light), `&&`, sensor fusion        |
| **5**   | 🛰 Talk to Other Robots (Team Agents)     | Simulate a network of agents: robot → forecast → deck status                     |
|         |                                           | Learn: JSON messages, `Serial.print()`, shared state, teamwork planning          |

## 🔍 Key Concepts Per Agent (Simplified Student View)

| **Agent Type**             | **Student Analogy**                           | **Starter Skill Focus**                                |
| -------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| 🧭 **Routing Agent**       | Like a traffic officer at a fork in the road  | `if/else`, counters, basic sensor input                |
| 🚦 **Traffic Controller**  | Like a stoplight or crossing guard            | Pausing logic, `while`, `if` conditions                |
| 🏗 **Resource Allocator**  | Like a manager assigning workers              | Task queues, prioritization via `switch`, arrays       |
| 🌡 **Env Awareness Agent** | Like a weather-aware pilot                    | Sensor readings, multi-condition logic                 |
| 🎯 **Goal-Seeking Agent**  | Like a coach tracking score during a game     | Simple feedback loop, `goals`, adaptive thresholds     |
| 📡 **Communication Agent** | Like texting your friend while playing a game | `Serial`, shared JSON, simulated inter-agent broadcast |

## 🛠 Optional Add-On Modules for Advanced Groups

### 🧰 Tools You Might Offer

* **Finite State Machines** (FSM)

  * Use a `state` variable to define modes like `WAITING`, `MOVING`, `REROUTING`
* **Basic Feedback Mechanism**

  * Reward correct placement by increasing score (simulated reward function)
* **Simulated Communication**

  * Use JSON packets or string parsing (`"arm: deckA: red"`) via `Serial` or screen

## 🧪 Optional Challenge Tracks for Students

| **Challenge**           | **What it Tests**                       | **Example**                                       |
| ----------------------- | --------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| "Deck Manager"          | Memory + logic                          | Can you cap deck capacity to 5 items?             |
| "Safe Routing"          | Sensor fusion                           | Can you avoid heat zones when routing food?       |
| "Forecast Failsafe"     | Agent communication                     | Can you reroute if a teammate says “Deck C full”? |
| "Bonus: LLM Help Agent" | LLM on the Edge (teacher demo optional) | Can LLM assist in deciding where to route?        |

## 💡 Scaffolded Extension: **LLM on the Edge** (Teacher Preview / Bonus Demo)

Let students **watch or review** this phase rather than build it themselves:

* Use a small quantized model (TinyML or DistilBERT) or just simulate logic with an LLM-backed server.
* Ask: "Based on these messages, what should we do?"
* Great time to discuss the **future of edge AI** + agents with LLM decision-support.
