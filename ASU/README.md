### 🧭 **How to Use This Repo**

1. **Start in `1-Sessions/`** – Each day’s learning content includes all background needed. No hunting for extra docs.
2. **Explore `2-Capstone-Missions/`** – Missions like Nova, Vega, and Orion include setup instructions and embedded story context right in each team folder.
3. **Use `3-Presentation-Slides/`** – Log your team progress daily and prepare your final demo with built-in templates.
4. **Train models with `4-Modeling-Material/`** – Includes labeled examples and AI techniques for student customization.
**Train models with `4-Modeling-Material/`** – Includes labeled examples and AI techniques for student customization.
6. **Need quick help?** A guided, step-by-step assistant will be available soon to walk you through building your own camp setup. 🛠️
