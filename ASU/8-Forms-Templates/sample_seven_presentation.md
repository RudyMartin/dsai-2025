# NASA Artemis Data Science AI Camp — Summer 2025


---

\## Slide 1 — Title & Crew

* **Mission name**
* **Crew roster** (first names are fine!)
* **Mission patch / fun tagline** *(image placeholder)*

> **Speaker note:** “Hey everyone, we’re Team \_\_\_ and we just survived the wildest build‑week ever.”

---

\## Slide 2 — Mission Goal & Journey Map

* **In one tweet:** “Build a robot that \_\_\_.”
* **Why it’s cool for Artemis:** \_\_\_ (e.g., rock sorting on the Moon)
* **Journey timeline:**

  * Day 1–3 ➜ waiting for support, sketching ideas
  * Day 4–6 ➜ hardware builds, sensor tests
  * Last 24 h ➜ speed‑run model training & integration

> **Speaker note:** Start with the ‘why,’ then walk through the timeline—audience loves a suspense arc.

\## Slide 3 — How It Works (3‑Part Tour)

| Piece            | What it does                |
| ---------------- | --------------------------- |
| ESP32‑S3 / Pi    | Brains—runs the ML model    |
| Camera / sensors | Eyes & ears—collect data    |
| PCA9685 + servos | Muscles—move the arm & gate |
| LED/OLED         | Mood ring—shows status      |

*(Block diagram placeholder: **Capture → Classify → Act → Log**)*

> **Speaker note:** “Like a mini Mars rover: eyes, brain, wheels—done!”

---

\## Slide 4 — Skills Unlocked & Tech Toolbox

* **Coding sprint after 3‑day delay:** VS Code shortcuts, live‑share debug
* **Model basics:** TinyML (TFLite, 32 kB) trained on 1 200 images
* **Hardware hacks:** PWM tuning, cardboard glare hood
* **New geek cred:** Git pushes, FSM design, prompt‑engineering on Roboflow 😉
* **GitHub:** QR or short link

> **Speaker note:** Pick one “aha!” trick that saved the day.

\## Slide 5 — Roadblocks & Breakthrough Moments

1. **Tech‑support timeout (3 days)** → turned wait time into brainstorming & paper protos
2. **Servo jitter** → added debounce + slower ramp
3. **Last‑day time crunch** → split tasks: hardware vs. model‑training sprint

*(Add candid photos: late‑night coding, sticky‑note wall, high‑five moment)*

> **Speaker note:** Keep it real—everyone relates to “nothing works at 2 a.m.”

---

\## Slide 6 — What We Learned (the Good Stuff)

* Timeboxing beats perfectionism
* Log everything—serial print = black box
* Tiny models can win big when power is tight
* Team vibes matter: memes keep morale up 🛰️

> **Speaker note:** “Future‑us will remember the process more than the numbers.”

---

\## Slide 7 — Next Launch Window

* Polish the model & test on real blocks
* Add depth sensor to kill glare issues
* Share dataset with Team Orion for cross‑training
* Hit us up—scan QR for collab!
