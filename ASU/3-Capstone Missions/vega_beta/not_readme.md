## üö™ **Team Vega Beta ‚Äì Airlock Object Gate + Sensor Monitoring (ESP32-S3)**  
**With Optional Camera Support**

---

### üéØ **Mission Role**  
Manage an **automated airlock system** that detects incoming objects using sensors, opens/closes a gate (servo), and logs access.  
Now enhanced with **camera vision** to optionally monitor or verify entries.

---

### üß± **LEGO Build Purpose**

Build an airlock or habitat access station with:

- A **servo-powered gate**
- Light/motion/temperature sensors
- Optional: a **camera to capture** object entering the airlock
- Gate opens/closes automatically based on sensor input or system status

### üîÅ **Interaction Flow (with Camera)**

1. Object nears gate ‚Üí motion sensor triggers  
2. Camera captures image (optional)  
3. System checks light/temp conditions  
4. If clear ‚Üí gate opens via servo  
5. Log entry:  
   `{timestamp, entry: YES, temp: 24¬∞C, light: LOW, image: gate_entry_002.jpg}`  
6. Orion pulls logs to understand usage patterns, deck safety

### ‚è±Ô∏è **Feasibility Timeline with Camera**

| Day       | Activities                                                                 |
|-----------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Day 1** | Breadboard test: motion sensor, servo, optional camera setup               |
| **Day 2** | Build airlock frame + servo mount; test gate logic                         |
| **Day 3** | Add sensors + integrate logging + snapshot trigger                         |
| **Day 4** | Log validation with Orion + multi-condition triggers                       |
| **Day 5** | Polish: camera angle, gate flow, final test cycle                          |

---

### üõ†Ô∏è **Design Constraints**
- Servo motion must **respond to sensors** in real time  
- Log entries must include enough info for **Orion analysis**
- If camera is used, **image filenames** must be consistent with logs

---

### üí° Optional Upgrades
- Add LED color indicators for gate state (green=open, red=closed)  
- Add override switch to simulate pressure lock state  
- Create time delay logic (e.g., gate closes after 5 seconds)

---

Next up: want **Orion Alpha** or **Orion Beta** expanded with optional camera activities?

## üå°Ô∏è Team Vega Beta ‚Äì Environmental Sensor Monitoring + Condition Logging (ESP32-S3)

---

### 1. üéØ **Mission Role**  
> Monitor deck conditions (e.g., light, temperature, motion) and determine if **incoming objects** from Nova are allowed under current environmental thresholds.  
Trigger **physical actions** (e.g., open a LEGO airlock) or **log alerts** if safety thresholds are violated.  
Vega Alpha is the **first responder** to object drop-offs.

---

### 2. üß± **LEGO Build Purpose**  
Build a **sealed LEGO test chamber** to simulate a habitat module.  
- Sensors are mounted inside (light, temp, motion)  
- An NXT servo motor opens a hatch if the object passes all safety checks  
- Optional: light filters or shaded areas to simulate safe/unsafe deck zones  
- The object comes in from Nova Alpha and is evaluated **before entry is permitted**

---

### 3. üß∞ **Required LEGO + Hardware Parts**

| Type | Qty | Purpose |
|------|-----|---------|
| LEGO baseplate | 1 | Test chamber base |
| Technic bricks/beams | 10‚Äì20 | Build structure and mount sensors |
| Transparent bricks | Optional | Simulate ‚Äúwindow‚Äù letting in light |
| LEGO object tray | 1 | For incoming objects from Nova |
| ESP32-S3 | 1 | Reads sensors and controls output |
| Light sensor (e.g., LDR) | 1 | Measures ambient light level |
| Temp sensor (e.g., DHT11/DHT22) | 1 | Measures thermal safety |
| Optional: motion or proximity sensor | 1 | Detects if object arrived |
| NXT servo motor | 1 | Opens hatch or signals ‚Äúsafe‚Äù |
| LED indicator | 1 | Green = safe, Red = reject |
| Wi-Fi connection | 1 | Sends log to NAS or Orion

---

### 4. üß™ **AI + Data Science System Actions**

| Component | Task |
|----------|------|
| **Sensor polling** | Read light/temp every second |
| **Threshold logic** | Compare values to safety limits (e.g., temp < 28¬∞C) |
| **Decision logic** | If all conditions OK ‚Üí open hatch; else ‚Üí blink red LED |
| **Flight log entry** | Write result: {object_id, time, status: safe/unsafe, values} |
| **Notify Orion** | Message or file written to NAS for logging or forecasting |
| **Data science hook** | Reflect: ‚ÄúHow many unsafe entries did we catch?‚Äù

---

### 5. üîÅ **Interaction Flow (with Space Deck Integration)**

```plaintext
Nova drops object into Vega‚Äôs LEGO chamber ‚Üí
Sensor scan begins ‚Üí
Light = OK, Temp = TOO HOT ‚Üí
Object is rejected, log written ‚Üí
Orion reads logs: ‚ÄòDeck A conditions unsafe for human‚Äô ‚Üí
Counts against safe capacity forecast
```

- The team learns to **tune thresholds** (e.g., adjust for shade, simulate coolers)
- Logs help Orion determine if a **dock override** or **environmental alert** is needed

---

### 6. ‚è±Ô∏è **Feasibility in 5-Day Camp**

‚úÖ Yes ‚Äî and sensor logic is easy to scaffold:
- Day 1: Test sensors individually on breadboard
- Day 2: Build LEGO structure, mount sensors
- Day 3: Combine reading + logic + motor control
- Day 4: Format logs, test integration with Nova
- Day 5: Final polish + real-time response demo

---

### üõ†Ô∏è **Design Constraint: Sensor Feedback + Log Required**

> ‚ú® ‚ÄúYour system must **analyze conditions of an incoming object and respond digitally and physically**.  
You must **log a result** to the flight manifest (safe/rejected + values), which Orion uses for forecasting and mission health.‚Äù
