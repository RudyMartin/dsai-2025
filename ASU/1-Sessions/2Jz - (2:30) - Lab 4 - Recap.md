## 🔭 Lab 4 Focus Recap

### 👇 What Changes:

* Lab 3: Action was based **solely on model confidence**
* Lab 4: Action is based on **confidence + external context**

  * e.g., temperature, light level, deck rules, time of day
  * Example: A "yes" classification might still be rejected if the environment is “unsafe”

---

## 🧠 Learning Goals:

* Combine multiple inputs
* Introduce conditional logic
* Reinforce FSM branching
* Treat environment as part of the **decision context**
