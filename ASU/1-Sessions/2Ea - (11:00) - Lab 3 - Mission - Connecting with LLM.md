Perfect — you're scaffolding a **progressive agent system** across labs with clarity and purpose. Here's how Lab 3 fits into the full learning arc and how we should frame and name it.

## 🧠 Lab Progression Context (So Far)

| Lab       | Focus                     | What Students Learn                                                                                              |
| --------- | ------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Lab 1** | 🤖 LLM/RAG Chatbot        | How to ask questions and get responses from a language model. Teaches basic reasoning + context use              |
| **Lab 2** | 🎯 Custom Vision Model    | Train a block classifier (6 colors × 2 sizes) using Roboflow. Export to Microcontroller                          |
| **Lab 3** | 🚨 Decision + Alert Agent | Turn classifier outputs into action **based on confidence**. Use FSM, light GPIO/LED/Buzzer based on result      |
| **Lab 4** | 🌐 Conditional Decisions  | Add **external conditions** (e.g. temperature, deck rules). Action is **context-dependent**, not just confidence |

## ✅ What Lab 3 Teaches

Lab 3 marks the transition:

* From passive model → **active agent**
* From output → **output + judgment**
* From basic loop → **FSM + real-world signals**

It’s the **first time the system reacts**. This is crucial in the agent design loop.

## 🔤 What Should We Call This Script?

### Primary Goals:

* Align with MCP + FSM loop
* Emphasize “confidence-based action”
* Prepare for conditional logic in next lab

---

### 🔧 Recommended Script Name:

```plaintext
lab3_confidence_alert_agent.ino
```

### 🔄 Next Step

Would you like me to rename and regenerate the file as `lab3_confidence_alert_agent.ino` now, or also create the folder scaffold for your lab repo?





| FSM State               | MCP Step | Meaning          |
| ----------------------- | -------- | ---------------- |
| `STATE_SENSE_INPUT`     | Sense    | Read JSON input  |
| `STATE_DECIDE_ACTION`   | Plan     | Parse + choose   |
| `STATE_ACT_ON_DECISION` | Act      | Show result      |
| `STATE_LOG_RESULT`      | Log      | Print to Serial  |
| `STATE_WAIT_NEXT_INPUT` | Repeat   | Prepare for next |
