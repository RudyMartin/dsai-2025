Student-Friendly Questions:

What did I accomplish for our team's goal since our last check-in?
What will I work on before our next check-in?
Is anything slowing me down or blocking me? (Do I need help?)

The goal is not a status report for the teacher. It's a planning and synchronization meeting for the team, by the team.
