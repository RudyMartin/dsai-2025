### âœ… **Part 1: Your Project â€“ Deploying a Small Model (5 Color Cubes Ã— 2 Sizes)**

Youâ€™re trying to detect and identify wooden blocks by **color** and **size**. That gives you **10 classes** (e.g., `red_small`, `blue_large`, etc.).

#### ðŸªœ Next Steps with Roboflow + ESP32-S3:

1. **Collect and Label Data**

   * Capture clear images of the cubes from your ESP32 camera or another consistent camera.
   * Upload to [Roboflow](https://roboflow.com).
   * Create **labels like:** `red_small`, `red_large`, `blue_small`, etc.
   * Recommended: 50â€“100+ images per class.

2. **Choose Project Type in Roboflow**

   * For your task, select **Image Classification** (see Part 2 below).
   * Why not Object Detection? Because you're classifying the *whole image* (one cube centered in frame), not locating many in one frame.

3. **Train Your Model in Roboflow**

   * Use Roboflow Train or export and train with TFLite manually.
   * Choose **TinyML-compatible models**, e.g., `MobileNet`, `EfficientNet-Lite`.

4. **Export to ESP32-S3 Format**

   * In Roboflow, go to **"Export" â†’ "TensorFlow Lite"**.
   * Choose `int8 quantized TFLite` for microcontroller compatibility.

5. **Deploy to ESP32-S3**

   * Use [Edge Impulse](https://edgeimpulse.com), [TensorFlow Lite Micro](https://www.tensorflow.org/lite/microcontrollers/overview), or [ESP-DL](https://github.com/espressif/esp-dl) to run the `.tflite` model.
   * Flash your ESP32-S3 with:

     * Camera init + image capture code
     * TFLite interpreter
     * Inference + result display logic (e.g., send to OLED or log over UART)

### ðŸ¤– **Part 2: What Do the Model Types Mean?**

When Roboflow asks you to choose a **project type**, hereâ€™s what each means:

| **Type**                  | **Meaning**                                                                 | **Use Case**                                                        |
| ------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Object Detection**      | Detect **what** and **where** objects are. Outputs bounding boxes + labels. | Use if images have **multiple items** and you care about location.  |
| **Classification**        | Assign a single label to the **entire image**.                              | âœ… Use this if there's one cube per image. Most efficient for ESP32. |
| **Image Segmentation**    | Label **each pixel** in an object (precise shape).                          | Heavy, not for ESP32. Used in self-driving, medical, etc.           |
| **Keypoint Detection**    | Find positions like joints in a hand or person.                             | Used in pose detection, gesture tracking. Not your case.            |
| **Semantic Segmentation** | Label each pixel by **class**, not instance.                                | Similar to segmentation. Usually GPU required.                      |

### ðŸš€ Summary: Your Best Path

Youâ€™re doing:

> **Single object (cube), entire image, 10 labels = Use Image Classification**

Steps:

1. Collect + label images â†’ Roboflow
2. Train model in Roboflow
3. Export TFLite quantized model
4. Deploy using TensorFlow Lite Micro on ESP32-S3
