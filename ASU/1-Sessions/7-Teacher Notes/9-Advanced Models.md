Here’s a menu of **“faster / cheaper / better” object-detection training paths** you can swap in for the 3-hour Roboflow run.  I grouped them by what usually matters most to students:

| Goal                                       | Platform (free tier unless noted)        | Typical turnaround on a *small camp dataset* (≈300–800 images)           | Cost notes                                                             | Why it’s faster / cheaper                                                                                                                     | MCP/FSM fit                                                                                 |
| ------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Click-train in < 5 min**                 | **Ultralytics HUB**                      | Seconds–a few minutes for YOLOv8-nano                                    | Free for three projects                                                | All compute on vendor GPU, no notebook setup; export to TFLite, ONNX, etc. quickly. ([ultralytics.com][1])                                    | Drop model in your existing `CLASSIFY` state; HUB gives a `.pt` you can load with one line. |
| **Micro-controller tune in ≤ 20 min**      | **Edge Impulse**                         | Hard 20 min wall on free plan; usually 3–10 min for FOMO / MobileNet SSD | Free                                                                   | Uses highly-optimized Keras presets + “EON Tuner” suggestions; tiny models for ESP32. ([forum.edgeimpulse.com][2])                            | Produces C++ or TFLite micro libs that slot into the `PLAN/ACT` steps on your ESP32-S3 FSM. |
| **Notebook DIY, free GPU**                 | **Google Colab** or **Kaggle Notebooks** | 5–15 min (YOLOv8-nano, 50 epochs, T4/P100 GPU)                           | \$0; Colab & Kaggle give \~30 GPU hrs/wk                               | You control epochs/model size; restart instantly if you tweak. Kaggle GPU quota: 30 hrs/wk. ([docs.ultralytics.com][3], [ultralytics.com][4]) | Notebook → save weights → upload to FAISS & edge device; logs back into your `LOG` state.   |
| **Quick transfer-learning, pay-as-you-go** | **AWS SageMaker JumpStart**              | \~10–30 min fine-tuning a pre-built SSD or YOLO model                    | Example training bill: **\$2.38** (4 short runs) ([aws.amazon.com][5]) | One-click “Fine-Tune”; spot/Graviton or g4dn instances keep costs tiny; auto-handles GPUs & S3.                                               | Fine-tune → push to S3 → Lambda or Bedrock endpoint → your FSM’s `PLAN` can call it.        |
| **Point-and-shoot web GUI**                | **Azure Custom Vision**                  | Often finishes in **< 5 min** for <1 k images                            | 1 hr of training free / mo; pay ≈ \$10 per compute-hr after            | Aggressive transfer learning on ResNet backbones; instant REST endpoint.

| **AutoML with larger data**                | **Google Vertex AI Vision**              | Tens of minutes to \~1 hr (--n scalable GPUs)                            | Pay-as-you-train; billed by GPU-node-time                              | Handles bigger datasets than Colab without notebook limits; export TFLite quantized.

### Speed & cost hacks that work everywhere

1. **Use the smallest model variant first**
   `yolov8n.pt` (nano) or `MobileNet-SSD-256` trains 3-4× faster than full YOLOv8s and is still plenty for colored blocks.

2. **Freeze most layers (transfer learning)**
   Only the last few layers update → ∼ 70 % less training time.

3. **Cut epochs aggressively**
   With a pre-trained backbone, 30–50 epochs often converges; set **EarlyStopping** so training halts as soon as val-loss plateaus.

4. **Increase batch size** (if the platform lets you)
   Bigger batches keep GPUs busy → fewer gradient steps → faster wall-clock.

5. **Convert detection → classification when possible**
   If the scene has one object, a classifier is 10× smaller & faster to train.

6. **Log embeddings, not images**
   Once a model is decent, extract the 512-D penultimate-layer vector and push that into FAISS during your `LOG` state; inference stays GPU-light.

### Picking the right option for camp day

| If you need…                                | Choose                                                                   |
| ------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| *Absolute fastest demo in class*            | **Ultralytics HUB** – you’ll have a trained model before the bell rings. |
| *Edge deployment on ESP32-S3*               | **Edge Impulse** (FOMO) or **Colab + TFLite int8** for YOLOv8-nano.      |
| *No credit card / still free*               | **Kaggle** or **Colab** notebooks with free GPU.                         |
| *Production-ish workflow & Git integration* | **SageMaker JumpStart** (cheap spot) or **Vertex AI**.                   |
| *Graphical drag-and-drop + REST API*        | **Azure Custom Vision**.                                                 |

Using any of these, students can **swap the new weights into the existing MCP/FSM chain** like so:

```python
# CLASSIFY state snippet (Colab-trained YOLOv8 example)
model = YOLO("best.pt")              # Plan
results = model(img)                 # Act
faiss_log.store(embeddings(results)) # Log -> your FAISS DB
```

They’ll see instant feedback in the next mission run—and you’ve shaved hours (and dollars) off training time.
