1G – Your First Object Detection Program

Purpose: Start simple with object detection using Roboflow or a static model.

Supports: Prepares students for 1J/1Ja/1Jb/1Jc sensor-based labs.

## Day 1 - Visual Classifier Intro
# Slide 1: What is Classification?
- Classification = Putting things into groups.
- Example: Sorting fruits as apple, banana, or orange.
- Why it matters: Helps computers understand images.

# Slide 2: Labeling Examples
- Show 3 sample images.
- Ask: What label would you give each image?
- Transition to idea of training data.

# Slide 3: Build Your Own Classifier (Live Demo)
- Code sample: if 'red and round' then 'apple'
- Try adding one more condition together.
- Explain what happens when data is unclear.
