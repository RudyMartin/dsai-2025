2C – Learn – Designing Agentic Systems

Purpose: Explain what makes a system “agentic” (state, goal, response).

Supports: 2Ea Labs involving real-time prediction and LED integration.

## Day 2 - Agent Design & Decision Flow
# Slide 1: What is an Agent?
- An agent senses, decides, and acts.
- Example: Thermostat senses temperature, turns heater on/off.

# Slide 2: Decision Diagram
- Use a flowchart: `Sensor -> Rule -> Action`
- Add a state: 'If light < 50 and object = food, move to Deck B'

# Slide 3: Code Behavior Together
- Walk through simple `if/else` logic
- Highlight importance of real-time updates.
