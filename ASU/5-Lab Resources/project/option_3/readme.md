### 3. **Resource Allocation Agent**

**Add-on Concept**: Have multiple robot arms or stations. The agent chooses which one to assign tasks to.

| Incoming Task | Assignment Logic                   |
| ------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| Large block   | Assign to Arm B (heavier capacity) |
| Urgent class  | Assign to nearest available arm    |

**Agent Behavior:** Task prioritization and load balancing
