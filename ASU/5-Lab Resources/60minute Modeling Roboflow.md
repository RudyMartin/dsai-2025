### Quickest Path to a Working Model (The "Crunched for Time" Plan)

Follow these steps exactly to get a result as fast as possible.

**Step 1: Data Collection (5-10 minutes)**

*   Take **20-30 pictures** of your wood blocks.
*   **CRITICAL:** Make sure you vary the **lighting** (bright, dim, shadows) and **backgrounds** (on a desk, in a box, on the floor). This is more important than taking hundreds of pictures in the same spot.
*   Include multiple blocks of different colors in the same picture.

**Step 2: Labeling in Roboflow (15-20 minutes)**

1.  Create a new project in Roboflow.
2.  Upload your images.
3.  When you start annotating, **make your class names the colors themselves.**
    *   Instead of one class called `block`, create classes like `red_block`, `blue_block`, `green_block`, etc.
    *   Draw a bounding box around each block and assign it the correct color class.

**Step 3: Augmentation (1 minute)**

*   When generating your dataset version, Roboflow will prompt you to add augmentations.
*   **Don't overthink it.** Add augmentations that mimic real-world lighting changes. The most important ones for your task are:
    *   **Brightness**
    *   **Hue** (This is VERY important for teaching the model what "red" looks like in different lighting)
    *   **Saturation**
    *   **Noise**
*   Roboflow has pre-built augmentation settings. Just pick one and move on.

**Step 4: Training (1-2 minutes of setup)**

1.  Click **"Train New Model"**.
2.  Select **YOLOv8** from the model library.
3.  Choose the **"Fast"** training option to get a quick baseline. It will train in the cloud. You'll get an email when it's done (usually 30-60 minutes, depending on dataset size).

**Step 5: Test & Deploy (2 minutes)**

*   Once training is complete, go to the "Deploy" tab in Roboflow.
*   You can immediately test your model using your **webcam** or by uploading an image. This gives you instant feedback on its performance.

This entire process, excluding the wait time for training, can be done in **under an hour**.

### Quick Model Comparison (Just in case)

| Model | Why Choose It (For Your Project) | Why Avoid It |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **YOLOv8** | **(Your Best Bet)** The best mix of speed, accuracy, and ease of use. Great for small objects. | Slightly slower than YOLOv5 on some hardware, but the accuracy gain is worth it. |
| **YOLOv5** | Still very fast and reliable. If your deployment device is extremely limited (like a Raspberry Pi), this is a solid second choice. | It's an older architecture. YOLOv8 will almost certainly give you better accuracy for the same effort. |
| **EfficientDet** | Can be very accurate, especially in cluttered scenes. | Significantly slower to train and run than YOLO models. Not ideal when you're "crunched for time." |
| **RT-DETR** | State-of-the-art accuracy, but more complex and slower. | Overkill for this task and not the fastest path to a solution. |

**Final Recommendation:** **Stick with YOLOv8.** It's the fastest path from zero to a high-quality, working model for your specific problem, especially using the Roboflow platform.
