## Conveyor Allocation Summary

| Hardware            | Assigned To               | Rationale                                        |
| ------------------- | ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| **Large conveyor**  | **Nova Alpha**            | Primary sorter needs room & throughput           |
| **Kit conveyor #1** | **Vega Beta**             | Simple gate demo—no fabrication overhead         |
| **Kit conveyor #2** | **Orion Beta** (or spare) | Adds motion flair; discardable if schedule tight |

## Robot Arm Allocation Summary

| Hardware         | Assigned To                                   | Rationale                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| ---------------- | --------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Robot Arm #1** | **Nova Alpha – Object Detection + Actuation** | Their whole demo hinges on physical sorting. A ready-to-go arm lets them jump straight into AI-driven gate control instead of fabricating an actuator.                                    |
| **Robot Arm #2** | **Vega Beta – Environmental Gate**            | They need a servo-powered gate that blocks or admits objects. Dropping in an off-the-shelf arm turns “build hardware” into quick wiring, so the team can focus on sensor logic and rules. |
| **Robot Arm #3** | **Orion Beta – Robots That Talk**             | Adds eye-catching gestures (wave, point) to their voice-feedback robot without the distraction of mechanical assembly. Keeps their time free for speech synthesis and keyword-spotting.   |
