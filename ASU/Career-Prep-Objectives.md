**Summer Camp Track: Unleashing AI Power: Core Concepts & Smart Solutions**

**Overarching Goal:** By the end of this camp, students will understand how Artificial Intelligence learns and "thinks," and develop fundamental problem-solving skills to build and troubleshoot their own AI projects.

**Learning Objectives:**

**I. Core Deep Learning Fundamentals: Making Computers "Smart"**

*   **Understanding How AI Sees (Video AI):**
    *   Students will be able to **explain** how computers can identify objects, track movement, and understand actions in videos (like in self-driving cars or security cameras).
    *   Students will **identify** common tasks that AI performs in video analysis, such as "object detection" and "classification," and **recognize** their real-world applications.
    *   *Hands-on:* Students will **apply** a pre-trained AI model to perform basic object detection on sample images or videos.

*   **Understanding How AI Talks (Large Language Models):**
    *   Students will be able to **describe** what a "Large Language Model" (LLM) is and its basic function (e.g., generating text, answering questions).
    *   Students will **experiment with** "prompt engineering" by crafting effective instructions to guide AI models to produce desired text or responses.
    *   Students will **understand** the concept of "fine-tuning" â€“ how a general AI model can be adapted to become an expert in a specific topic using a small amount of new information.

*   **Making AI Models Nimble (Optimization Basics):**
    *   Students will **explain** why it's important to make AI models small and fast, especially for use on devices like phones or in real-time applications.
    *   Students will **identify** simple techniques like "quantization" (making AI models use less memory) and "pruning" (trimming unnecessary parts) that help speed up AI.

*   **Packaging AI for Success (Model Formats):**
    *   Students will **understand** the need for common ways to "package" AI models (like using a universal file format) so they can be easily used in different applications or on different devices.
    *   *Hands-on:* Students will **perform** a basic conversion of a simple AI model into a deployment-ready format.

**II. Problem Solving for AI Builders: Fixing & Improving**

*   **Becoming an AI Detective (Debugging & Troubleshooting):**
    *   Students will be able to **identify** common reasons why an AI model might give incorrect answers or why an AI program might stop working.
    *   Students will **apply** basic debugging strategies (e.g., checking inputs, understanding error messages) to troubleshoot and **solve** simple issues in AI code or model outputs.
    *   *Hands-on:* Students will be given "broken" AI code or models and challenged to **find and fix** the errors.

*   **Boosting AI's Speed (Performance Tuning):**
    *   Students will **measure** how fast a given AI model performs a task and **identify** what might be slowing it down (like complex instructions or too much data).
    *   Students will **propose** and **implement** simple adjustments to make an AI model run faster or more efficiently without losing much accuracy.
    *   *Hands-on:* Students will **compare** the performance of two different versions of an AI model and **optimize** one for speed.

*   **Teamwork in AI (Collaboration):**
    *   Students will **collaborate effectively** with their peers on a team project to build or refine an AI application.
    *   Students will **communicate** their ideas, challenges, and solutions clearly with their team members.
    *   Students will **contribute** to a shared goal, recognizing that successful AI development often involves diverse skills working together.
