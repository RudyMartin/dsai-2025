### Remaining “Support Crew” To-Do List

*(everything the mentors/tech staff still need to prep or unblock before the students can finish their Thursday builds)*

| Area                                  | What’s still missing?                                                                                                                                                                                                         | Why it matters / Next action                                                                                                  |
| ------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Power & Safety**                    | • Final 5 V / 3 V 3 rail distribution (conveyors + PCA9685 + LED matrix can pull >2 A).<br>• Inline fuses or polyfuse on each rail.<br>• Common ground verification between PCA9685, ESP32-S3, LED matrix, amps, and sensors. | Prevent brown-outs and random I²C resets. Quick action: cut & crimp barrel-to-screw-terminal pigtails; add 2 A fuse per team. |
| **Pin-mapping & Firmware Stubs**      | • Confirm I²C addresses and pin numbers for each PCA9685/LED-matrix combo.<br>• Provide *minimal* “hello-world” sketches: `conveyor_start() / stop()` and `servo_move(channel, angle)`.                                       | Students can copy/paste and focus on logic rather than hunting pin defs.                                                      |
| **MQTT / Wi-Fi Infrastructure**       | • Single SSID & password posted.<br>• Broker hostname/IP, port, and topic naming cheat-sheet.<br>• Pre-generated AWS IoT cert bundles (or test Mosquitto broker) zipped and shared.                                           | Without the broker, cross-team messaging, logs, and voice alerts will stall.                                                  |
| **Audio Chain Check**                 | • Solder speaker leads to MAX98357 breakout & test `example_tone()`.<br>• Verify left/right channel swap (some boards label OUT+ / OUT− inconsistently).                                                                      | Prevent “silent demo” panic; catch wiring reversals early.                                                                    |
| **Sensor Calibration**                | • Run quick SHT30 & PIR baseline script to capture “normal” deck values.<br>• Update threshold constants in each team’s config JSON.                                                                                          | Avoid false positives that can lock a gate shut or spam the logger.                                                           |
| **Conveyor Tuning**                   | • Belt tension & speed set screws adjusted so objects don’t drift.<br>• Emergency-stop switch wired in series with motor driver enable pin.                                                                                   | Keeps hardware failures from derailing demos or injuring fingers.                                                             |
| **Model Deployment**                  | • Convert Roboflow exports to correct format (`.tflite` for ESP-DL or ONNX if using external inference).<br>• Place models in `/data/` on SPIFFS or SD for each Nova Alpha board.                                             | Nova Alpha can’t test routing logic until the model loads cleanly.                                                            |
| **Documentation & Quick-start Cards** | • One laminated cheat sheet per team: pinout, power limits, topic names, and three CLI commands (`idf.py flash`, `ampy put`, etc.).                                                                                           | Cuts mentor interruptions and speeds self-debugging.                                                                          |
| **Spare Parts & Tools Staging**       | • Extra dupont jumpers, PCA9685 address jumpers, screwdrivers, hot-glue gun, zip-ties within easy reach.                                                                                                                      | Minimizes “search time” for little bits that break or go missing.                                                             |

> **Bottom line:**
> Get power rails safe, pins mapped, MQTT live, and a tested “blinky” sketch for every conveyor/servo/amp. Once those foundations are rock-solid, students can spend the rest of Thursday purely on software logic, integration tests, and polishing their demos.
