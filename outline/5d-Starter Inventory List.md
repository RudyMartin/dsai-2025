# 📦 2. **Starter Inventory List**  
> This is the minimum recommended hardware + LEGO + accessories needed to support **a functional 5-day camp** for 3–6 teams (20–24 students), based on mission-level builds for **Nova, Vega, Orion**.

---

## 🧠 Assumptions

- 3 Missions × 2 Teams = 6 total student teams  
- 3–5 students per team  
- You rotate parts as needed between test flights  
- Some devices (e.g. Pi or NXT) are reused across teams for cost efficiency
