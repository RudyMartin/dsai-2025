| | 2D | Morning Break | |
| | 2E | Object Classification, Detection, Test Mission Phase I | Complete setup and test detection models in teams with instructor support. <br> (Refined Objective) Students will understand that AI models need to be saved in specific, standardized "universal" formats (like ONNX conceptually) so they can be easily understood and and used by different software and hardware systems across various applications and devices. |
| | 2F | Lunch | |
| | 2G | Data Collection and Performance | Collect data and evaluate model performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and confusion matrix. <br> Participate in interactive demonstrations of model evaluation and error analysis. <br> (Refined Objective) Students will be able to measure the time it takes for their AI model to make a prediction on a given input (its "inference speed" or "latency"). |
| | 2H | Afternoon Break | |
| | 2I | Present Findings, Adjust Projects | Present data findings and make adjustments to baseline projects. <br> Explore alternative or add-on projects (e.g., gesture recognition, customer 360). |
| Day 3 | 3A | Welcome, Day Overview, Team Check-in | Recap Day 2, set goals for Day 3, and check in with teams using SCRUM methodology. |
| | 3B | Build on from Base Model | Continue developing and improving base models (details TBD). |
| | 3D | Morning Break | |

| | 3D | Hyperparameter Tuning | Learn about and apply hyperparameter tuning to improve models. <br> Document effects of tuning in teams. <br> (Refined Objective) Students will explain why it's important to make AI models small and fast, especially for use on devices like phones or in real-time applications (e.g., robots, live video analytics), distinguishing this "nimbleness" from just raw accuracy. <br> (Refined Objective) Students will recognize methods like "quantization" and "pruning" as conceptual ways to make AI models smaller and faster for deployment, used by professionals. |
| | 3F | Lunch | |
| | 3F | Team Collaboration & Iteration | Collaborate within teams to discuss progress, implement tuning, and iterate for optimal model performance. <br> (Refined Objective) Students will identify basic factors that influence an AI model's operating speed (e.g., model complexity, data size), and propose simple conceptual approaches to make an AI model run faster or more efficiently for real-time applications. |
| | 3H | Afternoon Break | |
| | 3H | Dashboard Development | Develop a dashboard (e.g., S3 bucket) for the base project. <br> Determine and present custom project metrics. <br> Practice real-time dashboard reporting. |
| | 3I | Reflection & Troubleshooting | Reflect on Mission Phase II and troubleshoot any issues encountered. |
| Day 4 | 4A | Welcome & Day Overview | Recap Day 3, set goals, and introduce Mission Phase III. |
| | 4B | Introduction to LLM | Learn what Large Language Models (LLMs) are and how they work, with real-world examples like ChatGPT. <br> (Refined Objective) Students will understand the concept of "fine-tuning" – how a general AI model can be adapted to become an expert in a specific topic using a small amount of new information, even if they don't do it hands-on. |
| | 4C | Morning Break | |
| | 4D | Morning Break | |
| | 4D | Incorporate LLM to Projects | Integrate LLMs into projects (e.g., voice recognition with robots, sentiment analysis). <br> Apply human-computer interaction and database concepts in team-based activities. <br> (Refined Objective) Students will experiment with and refine "prompt engineering" by crafting effective instructions to guide AI models to produce desired text or responses. |
| | 4F | Lunch | |
| | 4F | LLM Testing and Project Integration | Test Chatbox and run end-to-end project missions. <br> Incorporate HCI, database, object detection, and dashboard skills. |
| | 4H | Afternoon Break | |
