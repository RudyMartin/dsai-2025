### 5. **Goal-Seeking Agent with Feedback Loop**

**Add-on Concept**: Keep track of how many blocks of each type have been routed. Reprioritize based on “mission goals.”

| Current State             | Goal        | Adjustment         |
| ------------------------- | ----------- | ------------------ |
| Only 1 tool in Deck B     | Need 3      | Prioritize tools   |
| Too many humans on Deck A | Max reached | Reroute new humans |

**Agent Behavior:** Adaptive decision-making with feedback
