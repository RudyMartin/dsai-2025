# ðŸ“† 5-Day AI Camp Mission Schedule by Team 

| **Day** | **Nova (Alpha + Beta)** | **Vega (Alpha + Beta)** | **Orion (Alpha + Beta)** |
|:---|:---|:---|:---|
| **Day 1** | Collect training images (LEGO objects); test camera + ESP32/Pi connection | Connect sensors (light, temp, proximity); calibrate thresholds | Set up log templates; install presence sensors; configure base dashboards |
| **Day 2** | Train object detection model (Roboflow); deploy to ESP32/Pi; test predictions | Tune sensor thresholds; trigger alerts with LED or OLED displays | Train arrival confirmation model (Vision AI); test cargo detection and log results |
| **Day 3** | Run flight tests; record predictions and gate outcomes | Use sensors to accept/reject environmental states; add NXT servo hatches | Detect rule violations; raise flags via NXT motors; send "arrival cleared" or "arrival blocked" signals |
| **Day 4** | Optimize model accuracy; tune confidence thresholds; handle edge cases | Run multi-flight scenarios (hot deck, bright light challenges) | Forecast base capacity; queue cargo/docking alerts; simulate cross-team communication |
| **Day 5** | Final test flight; prepare and record demo videos | Final sensor safety history report; finalize alarms and logs | Full base operations demonstration; dashboards, arrival tracking, forecasting; final mission briefing |

# âœ¨ Notes on What Changed:
- **Orion** now clearly shows:
  - Vision AI for cargo arrival confirmation (Day 2 onward).
  - System health management and forecasting (Day 4â€“5).
  - Final demonstration includes real data tracking and alert simulations.
- **Nova** still leads on outbound cargo object recognition.
- **Vega** still leads on environmental safety during transit.

âœ… Full integration across Nova â†” Vega â†” Orion, **closing the mission loop**.
