Our individual “AI projects” can be turned into a **true systems simulation**, with dynamic inputs, forecasting, and mission impact. Let’s work through this carefully and build up the **Space Deck + Flights Simulation Model** that integrates:

- 🎯 Mission pressure  
- 📦 Resource tracking  
- 🧠 Forecasting (data science!)  
- ⚙️ Load balancing and decision logic  
- 📊 Dashboard feedback

## 🚀 **Space Deck Simulation Framework**

> Your AI-powered LEGO system is now running **scheduled flights** — deliveries of mission-critical items into a modular space habitat.  
Each **flight = a run** of 5–10 items through the full system (Nova → Vega → Orion).

---

### 🛰️ 1. **System Architecture Overview**

| Layer | Role |
|-------|------|
| **Nova Teams** | Detect/classify items (people, robots, food, tools) per object |
| **Vega Teams** | Sense environmental constraints per deck (light, temp, etc.) |
| **Orion Teams** | Log system state, forecast capacity needs, trigger alerts or dock/abort logic |
| **LEGO Builds** | Physically sort objects and represent deck state (light, flags, motion) |
| **Flight Coordinator (Instructor or automation)** | Sends a new “shipment manifest” for each round

---

### ✈️ 2. **What Is a Flight?**

> A “flight” is a **batch run** of incoming items (5–10), sent through the system one-by-one.

Each flight has:
- A randomized or scripted **manifest** (e.g., 3 people, 2 robots, 1 tool)
- A **time limit** or round duration
- A shared **tracking sheet** or live dashboard

---

### 🔄 3. **What Makes a Flight Successful?**

✅ Items are:
- **Correctly identified**
- **Properly routed** to acceptable decks based on:
  - Type
  - Current deck capacity
  - Environmental thresholds
- System doesn’t overfill or violate constraints (e.g., no more than 3 humans on Deck A)

❌ Flight **fails or partially fails** if:
- A deck is overloaded
- A person is routed to a robot bay
- Food is sent to an overheated zone
- Log mismatch or communication breakdown occurs

---

### 📈 4. **Forecasting & Docking Logic (Orion Focus)**

| Metric | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Deck usage over time** | Orion tracks how full each deck is getting |
| **Flight load profile** | Are more robots arriving than expected? |
| **Docking trigger** | If total load > 80% or a deck is at risk, Orion can initiate a **dock request**:  
  - Drop off humans  
  - Pick up new tools  
  - Clear space from Deck B

This introduces **predictive modeling**:
- “If we get 2 more food items, we’ll overload Deck C”
- “We need to dock in 1 more flight or fail”

---

### 🧩 5. **Where Prediction, AI, and LEGO Intersect**

| Role | System |
|------|--------|
| **Nova** | Learns to classify faster with better images — trains accuracy |
| **Vega** | May need to **adjust sensors** (e.g., shade Deck A to cool it) |
| **Orion** | Builds logistic forecasting — simple regression or moving average for supply vs capacity |
| **Instructor** | Can dynamically **stress-test teams** by changing manifest proportions between flights

---

### 📊 6. **Flight Dashboard Metrics (Instructor or Orion Displays)**

| Metric | What it Tracks |
|--------|----------------|
| ✅ Flight Success | % of items routed correctly |
| ⚠️ Warnings Issued | e.g., overfilled deck, unsafe conditions |
| 🚀 Dock Triggers | Number of times docking was called |
| 📦 Inventory Map | Deck-by-deck status after each flight |
| 🧠 Forecast Accuracy | Did Orion correctly predict the outcome of this flight?

---

### 🧠 7. **Design Constraint Addition (Flight-Based)**

> ✨ “Your system must operate in **multi-flight mode**, with dynamic inputs. You must account for **changing object proportions**, system constraints, and **generate outputs that help other teams make decisions** under pressure.”
