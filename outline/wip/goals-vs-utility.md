### 🔍 What does “optimizes for a utility function” mean?

A **utility function** is like a **scorecard** that tells an agent **how good or bad** a possible outcome is.  
Instead of just asking:
> “Did I reach the goal? Yes or no?”

A utility-based agent asks:
> “**How good** was the result — and **can I do better?**”

### 🧠 Example: Goal-Based vs. Utility-Based

#### 🥅 **Goal-Based Agent**  
Has a simple rule:
> *“I want to reach the goal.”*

- If it gets there, ✅ success.
- It doesn’t care *how* it got there.

📦 Example:  
Robot needs to get to charging station. It goes through the rain, bumps into stuff, but arrives.  
→ It’s satisfied. Goal achieved.

---

#### 🎯 **Utility-Based Agent**  
Wants the *best* way to reach the goal.

It asks:
> “Which path is shortest, safest, or uses the least energy?”

It assigns a **utility score** to each option — higher is better.

📦 Example:  
Robot calculates:
- Path A = short but slippery = score 5  
- Path B = longer but safe = score 9  
→ Robot picks B because **9 > 5**

### ⚖️ Why It Matters in Camp

**Goal-based camp bot**:  
> "If you detect FOOD, open gate."

**Utility-based camp bot**:  
> "If confidence > 90 and servo isn’t busy, open gate — otherwise wait or alert."

It's a **smarter, more adaptive agent**.
