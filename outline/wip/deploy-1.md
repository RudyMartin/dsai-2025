### üîß Where the Models Come From (ESP32-S3 Edition)

For ESP32-S3 teams (Nova Alpha, Vega Alpha, Vega Beta):

#### ‚úÖ **Model Source: Roboflow + Edge Training**
1. **Students collect image data** using phones or ESP32-CAM snapshots.
2. **Upload to Roboflow** for labeling and preprocessing (e.g., resizing to 96x96 or 128x128, grayscale or RGB).
3. **Train a lightweight model** in Roboflow or export to:
   - **TensorFlow Lite (TFLite) Micro** for classification
   - Quantized INT8 format to reduce memory footprint

#### ‚öôÔ∏è **How the Model Is Deployed**:
- Compiled into firmware using **Arduino IDE** or **PlatformIO**
- Uses **TensorFlow Lite Micro runtime** (embedded C++) ‚Üí runs on-device
- Model is <250KB ideally, fits in ESP32-S3 Flash
- Prediction loop triggered by image capture (camera or sensor snapshot)

### üß† For Raspberry Pi Teams (Nova Beta, Orion Alpha/Beta)

These have much more power:
- Use **TFLite** or **ONNX Runtime** on Pi 5
- Larger models allowed: up to 10‚Äì50MB typical
- Can even run **full object detection** (YOLOv5s/YOLOv8n or custom MobileNetSSD)
- Trained with Roboflow, exported, and deployed locally
