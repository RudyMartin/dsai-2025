| Team | Quick Wokwi Practice Example | How it Matches the Final Build |
|:---|:---|:---|
| **Nova Alpha** (Object detection + servo sorter) | **Servo motor movement** triggered by a button or sensor input in Wokwi | Simulates how sorting gate will physically move after object classification |
| **Vega Alpha** (Sensor wall) | **Read temp/light sensors** and **trigger LEDs/buzzer** when thresholds exceeded in Wokwi | Students learn the logic needed for live environment warnings |
| **Vega Beta** (Airlock with condition check) | **Sensor threshold triggers a motorized door** or LED alert in Wokwi | Same decision-tree logic they'll use for safe/unsafe object acceptance |
| **Orion Alpha** (Message hub) | **Blink LEDs based on incoming MQTT/UDP messages** in Wokwi | Same messaging/receiving action but simplified |
