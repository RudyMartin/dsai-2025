Example: camera, light sensor, dashboard screenshot, button

---

### 🔹 Outputs / Actions:
> What can the agent do in response?

Example: move servo, flash LED, send signal, trigger alert

---

### 🔹 Human in the Loop?
- [ ] Yes — how: `_________________`
- [ ] No — fully autonomous

---

### 🔹 Learning or Updating?

## 🧠 Optional: Rating Circle (Visual Thinking Aid)
Let students rate how “agentic” their bot is on each axis:

| Trait           | Score (1–5) |
|----------------|-------------|
| Autonomy        | 🔘🔘🔘⚪⚪ |
| Learning        | 🔘🔘⚪⚪⚪ |
| Planning        | 🔘⚪⚪⚪⚪ |
| Feedback Use    | 🔘🔘🔘🔘⚪ |
| Human Interaction | 🔘🔘⚪⚪⚪ |

## 🧩 Mermaid Agent Template (Diagram View)

You can duplicate this chart per team and swap in their system details:

flowchart TD
  subgraph AGENT["🤖 Agent: Nova Alpha"]
    INPUT[📷 Perception: Image Sensor]
    MODEL[🧠 Model: Classifier (NA_1.tflite)]
    STATE[🧾 Internal State: Last Prediction]
    DECIDE{Confidence ≥ Threshold?}
    ACT[🛞 Action: Servo Gate Movement]
    H1[👤 Human: Button Tie Breaker]
  end

  INPUT --> MODEL --> STATE --> DECIDE
  DECIDE -- Yes --> ACT
  DECIDE -- No --> H1 --> ACT
```
