     - **Training Models for Vision**: 
       - Use **Roboflow** to create datasets, annotate images, and train models for object detection.

   **Focus for TAs**: Walk students through creating and training object detection models. Guide them in using **Roboflow** for dataset creation and management.

### **3. Object Detection & Supervised Learning**
   - **YOLO Architecture and Object Detection**:
     - Understanding the YOLO (You Only Look Once) framework for real-time object detection.
     - How YOLO processes images, detects objects, and generates bounding boxes.
   - **Training and Evaluating Models**:
     - **Supervised Learning**: Labeling and using datasets to train models with known outcomes.
     - Performance evaluation metrics like **accuracy**, **precision**, **recall**, and **F1-score**.

   **Focus for TAs**: Assist in training models, tuning hyperparameters, and interpreting performance metrics. Help teams analyze detection accuracy and fix misclassifications.

### **4. Hyperparameter Tuning & System Integration**
   - **Hyperparameter Tuning**: 
     - Importance of hyperparameters in machine learning models (e.g., learning rate, batch size, epochs).
     - How to experiment with different settings to improve model performance.
   - **System Integration**:
     - Integrating AI models into a broader system (e.g., linking object detection models with a mission simulation system).
     - Creating **end-to-end pipelines** for automated data processing and decision-making.

   **Focus for TAs**: Teach students how to adjust model hyperparameters for better results and assist in integrating their models into the larger simulation system.

### **5. Forecasting & Resource Simulation**
   - **Resource Forecasting for Space Missions**:
     - Predicting **resource usage** (food, water, air, power) using AI models, based on mission parameters.
     - **Simulation models**: Building models that simulate the behavior of resources in a space mission environment.
   - **Scenario-Based Planning**:
     - Modeling different scenarios (e.g., equipment failure, resource depletion) and predicting outcomes based on various inputs.

   **Focus for TAs**: Guide students through the process of developing forecasting models and integrating them into their mission simulation.

### **6. Presentation Skills & Career Exploration**
   - **Developing Professional Communication**:
     - Creating impactful presentations that explain AI models, findings, and results.
     - Team collaboration for preparing presentations, including slides and demonstrations.
   - **Career Exploration in AI, Robotics, and Aerospace**:
     - Expose students to career opportunities in AI, robotics, and aerospace industries.
     - Provide insight into what skills are required in these fields and how students can pursue these careers.

   **Focus for TAs**: Support students in preparing and rehearsing their presentations. Encourage clarity and confidence in communicating their ideas. Ensure all technical work is well-documented and explained in simple terms.
