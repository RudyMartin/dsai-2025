Welcome to the **AI/Robotics Camp**! This week is designed to immerse students in the exciting world of AI, robotics, and mission planning. Below is the full schedule, including a breakdown of the activities and focus areas for the teaching assistants (TAs).

### **Key Teaching Assistant Focus Areas:**

1. **Facilitating Hands-On Activities:**
   - Ensure all teams are engaged during **LEGO/NXT build sessions** and help with **integration tests** involving sensors and motion control.
   - Be prepared to guide students through flight simulations, troubleshooting, and hands-on coding exercises.

2. **Technical Support and Troubleshooting:**

   - Support teams with technical challenges during the **Flight Simulations** and **midday repair sprints**.

3. **Encouraging Reflection and Iteration:**
   - After each activity, guide teams through **reflection sessions** to analyze what worked, what didn’t, and how to improve. Encourage iterative thinking: **model → test → fix**.

4. **Time Management:**
   - Keep track of time to ensure the activities stay on schedule.
   - Assist in transitions between sessions, ensuring students have adequate breaks and downtime.

5. **Presentation and Communication Skills:**
   - During Day 5 (Presentations), guide students in preparing their slides and practicing their 2-minute pitch.

### **Additional Notes for TAs:**
- **Be patient and proactive** when students face technical difficulties. Their ability to troubleshoot and reflect on their mistakes is an important learning opportunity.
- **Encourage teamwork** and ensure that every student is engaged during activities.
- **Provide continuous feedback** and help reinforce key concepts related to AI, robotics, and data science throughout the week.

We  will  adjust the schedule based on the flow of the camp.
**We will  use the gitbub  repo for updates of daily mission schedules.**
This plan is designed to keep things moving while providing ample time for reflection, troubleshooting, and collaboration.
