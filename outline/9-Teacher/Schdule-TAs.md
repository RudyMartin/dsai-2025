Welcome to the **AI/Robotics Camp**! This week is designed to immerse students in the exciting world of AI, robotics, and mission planning. Below is the full schedule, including a breakdown of the activities and focus areas for the teaching assistants (TAs).

### **Key Teaching Assistant Focus Areas:**

1. **Facilitating Hands-On Activities:**
   - Ensure all teams are engaged during **LEGO/NXT build sessions** and help with **integration tests** involving sensors and motion control.
   - Be prepared to guide students through flight simulations, troubleshooting, and hands-on coding exercises.

2. **Technical Support and Troubleshooting:**
   - Assist students with their **coding** in **Google Colab**, help them debug issues, and explain concepts during integration tests.
   - Support teams with technical challenges during the **Flight Simulations** and **midday repair sprints**.

3. **Encouraging Reflection and Iteration:**
   - After each activity, guide teams through **reflection sessions** to analyze what worked, what didn’t, and how to improve. Encourage iterative thinking: **model → test → fix**.

4. **Time Management:**
   - Keep track of time to ensure the activities stay on schedule.
   - Assist in transitions between sessions, ensuring students have adequate breaks and downtime.

5. **Presentation and Communication Skills:**
   - During Day 5 (Presentations), guide students in preparing their slides and practicing their 2-minute pitch.
   - Support them during the **Online Showcase**, ensuring the presentations run smoothly.
