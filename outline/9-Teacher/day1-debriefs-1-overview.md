# ✈️ 2025 AI Mission Camp — Flight Debrief System (Practical Version)

---

## 🛰️ 1. Simple Daily Debrief Frame for Students
✅ Tell them every day:

> "A debrief is **not about blame**.  
It’s about telling the story of your mission — the good, the weird, and the things you’ll fix for tomorrow."

✅ Daily Format (keep it simple!):

| Step | Debrief Question | Why |
|:---|:---|:---|
| 1️⃣ | What went well today? | Celebrate wins! Build momentum. |
| 2️⃣ | What surprised us? | Highlight unexpected issues without shame. |
| 3️⃣ | Where did the system behave differently than expected? | Focus attention on system behavior, not on blaming teammates. |
| 4️⃣ | What will we adjust tomorrow? | Encourage *forward-looking mindset*. |

**TA Tip:** *Require every team to give at least one answer for each.*

## 🧠 2. Prepping Students for Reflection (Since Some Are New)

At the very start of the camp (Monday Morning),  
explain **what a Flight Debrief is** in 1 minute:

> "**In engineering missions, teams meet after every flight to talk about what happened.  
Not to blame, not to lecture — but to make the next flight better.  
You'll learn to observe your system like an engineer, not just a builder.**"

✅ Remind them that:
- **Mistakes are normal** in real-world missions.
- **"We don’t know yet"** is an acceptable answer.
- **We’re practicing thinking, not winning.**

## 📋 3. Practical "Starter" Prompts for Debriefing
(**High School level — easy to connect**)

| Category | Starter Prompts |
|:---|:---|
| 📷 Model Behavior (Nova) | "Did your model predict confidently?" "Did it change its mind?" |
| 🌡️ Sensor Behavior (Vega) | "Did the readings make sense?" "Were they stable or jumpy?" |
| 🧾 Data & Logs (Orion) | "Did you receive all the files?" "Were there missing entries?" |
| ⚙️ Physical Systems | "Did motors/servos move as expected?" |
| ⏱️ Timing Issues | "Did alerts happen on time, or were they too late/early?" |

## 🧰 4. Flight Debrief Tips by Team (based on your original .md examples)

| Team | Tip |
|:---|:---|
| **Nova (AI Models)** | "Video a few flights. Watch if the model 'waffles' or hesitates." |
| **Vega (Sensors)** | "Create safe zones or shade zones near sensors; document what affects readings." |
| **Orion (Forecasting)** | "Simulate 'walk-by' events to see if the system reacts correctly." |

✅ **TAs should lightly guide** (not lecture) — ask questions, not give answers.

# 🛎️ 5. Final Reminder for Students

> "**Flight debriefs are part of your mission.  
Just like pilots review every flight to improve,  
you’ll build stronger systems by noticing what your data is trying to tell you.**"

---

# 🚀 TL;DR
✅ Daily Debrief = short, honest, story-driven reflection.  
✅ Students get 4 easy questions every day: *What went well? What surprised us? What behaved weirdly? What will we change?*  
✅ TAs prompt teams using simple cues from sensors, models, physical movement, timing.

✅ **You are training them to think like real engineers, not just coders or builders.**
