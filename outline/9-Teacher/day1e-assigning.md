# 🧠 Why Assign Teams *Before* Flight 1 + Flight 2?

| Reason | Why It Matters |
|:---|:---|
| **Build Ownership Early** | Students need to *feel* connected to "their system" — otherwise, Flight 1 feels like "some random thing" instead of *their mission*. |
| **Set Clear Roles for Simulation** | You can't practice "human-in-the-loop" versus "no-human" if nobody knows who was supposed to act! |
| **Flight Log Consistency** | Teams need to know where to save logs, how to annotate "who decided what", and prepare for debriefing. |
| **Faster Emotional Engagement** | Students start caring about system failures when it’s *their* team’s system that failed. |
| **Better Team Learning Loops** | If students experience problems **together**, they can brainstorm fixes **together** after Flight 2. |

# 🎯 Flight Timeline Recommendation

| Time | Action |
|:---|:---|
| **Before Flight 1** | Assign teams + Assign mission badges/roles. Brief teams: "You are now the Nova Alpha crew..." |
| **Flight 1** | Scripted success. Everything works. Students operate systems together. |
| **Debrief 1** | Quick group reflection (feel good, celebrate "perfect" flight). |
| **Flight 2** | Remove human-in-the-loop. Let students experience system failures together. |
| **Debrief 2** | Identify where humans *should have intervened* and what data was missing. |

✅ This flow **builds emotional investment early**,  
✅ and **creates real mission identity** among teams.

# 🛎️ Important Practical Tip:
✅ You **don’t have to assign permanent teams forever** before Flight 1.  
✅ You can tell students:

> "**Teams for today's mission simulation are provisional. We may rebalance slightly after the first two flights based on system performance and teamwork styles.**"

✅ This gives you **flexibility** in case a team is too stacked (e.g., all super-coders or all beginners).

# 🚀 TL;DR
✅ YES, assign teams BEFORE Flight 1.  
✅ It’s critical for real teamwork, ownership, system learning, and emotional engagement.  
✅ Treat Flight 1 as **"their first real flight"** even if it's scripted.
