### üìù Notes:

* ¬π The matrix panel itself depends on what resolution and scan rate you want. Common choices:

  * 64√ó64 2.5mm pitch: [Adafruit PID 2277](https://www.adafruit.com/product/2277) (currently out of stock often)
  * 64√ó64 3mm or 4mm pitch available on SparkFun, AliExpress, Amazon, etc.
* The **ESP32** could be:

  * [ESP32-S3 Feather (PID 5395)](https://www.adafruit.com/product/5395)
  * Or use other dev boards if you adapt the GPIOs in code

Would you like a matching wiring diagram with all these PID-labeled components?

## üõ†Ô∏è STEP-BY-STEP ASSEMBLY

---

### **üîã POWER CONNECTION ‚Äì PANEL SIDE**

1. **Insert 4-pin power cable**
   ‚û§ Plug the **JST-VH (white plug)** into the power port on the LED panel
   *(It only fits one way.)*

2. **Wire power leads to terminal block**
   ‚û§ Take the **2 red wires** from the pigtail ‚Üí insert into **‚Äú+‚Äù** terminal
   ‚û§ Take the **2 black wires** ‚Üí insert into **‚Äú‚Äì‚Äù** terminal
   ‚û§ Tighten screws firmly.

3. **Connect to power supply**
   ‚û§ Plug **barrel jack of the 5V 4A power adapter** into the DC screw terminal
   ‚û§ Plug the adapter into the wall **(do this last)**

---

### **üìä DATA CONNECTION ‚Äì PANEL TO ESP32**

4. **Attach 2x8 ribbon cable**
   ‚û§ Plug one end into the **HUB75 data connector** on the matrix (usually labeled ‚ÄúIN‚Äù or ‚ÄúInput‚Äù)
   ‚û§ Leave the other end to wire to the ESP32

5. **Wire the ribbon to ESP32 GPIOs**
   Here‚Äôs a **common wiring table**:

| HUB75 Pin | Ribbon Color | ESP32 GPIO | Function      |
| --------- | ------------ | ---------- | ------------- |
| R1        | Red          | GPIO 25    | Red (upper)   |
| G1        | Green        | GPIO 26    | Green (upper) |
| B1        | Blue         | GPIO 27    | Blue (upper)  |
| R2        | ...          | GPIO 14    | Red (lower)   |
| G2        | ...          | GPIO 12    | Green (lower) |
| B2        | ...          | GPIO 13    | Blue (lower)  |
| A         | ...          | GPIO 15    | Row select    |
| B         | ...          | GPIO 2     | Row select    |
| C         | ...          | GPIO 4     | Row select    |
| D         | ...          | GPIO 5     | Row select    |
| LAT       | ...          | GPIO 32    | Latch         |
| OE        | ...          | GPIO 16    | Output Enable |
| CLK       | ...          | GPIO 33    | Clock         |
| GND       | Black        | GND        | Shared Ground |

> ‚ú≥Ô∏è **Important:** Only use the panel‚Äôs **GND wire** to connect to ESP32 **GND** for logic stability.

---

### **üíª POWER UP + TEST**

6. **Power on sequence**
   ‚û§ Plug in **ESP32 to USB first**
   ‚û§ THEN plug in the **5V adapter to wall power**
   *(This avoids brownout or boot errors.)*

7. **Upload demo code**
   ‚û§ Use Arduino with `ESP32-HUB75-MatrixPanel-DMA` library
   ‚û§ Try an example sketch like `PatternPlasma` or `ScrollingText`

---

## ‚úÖ You‚Äôre Done!

You now have:

* Clean power delivery (no smoke üí®)
* Ribbon-wired GPIO control
* Shared ground for logic signals
* Flicker-free panel once your code is running

---

## üß† Final Notes

* ‚úÖ **Do not power ESP32 from this 5V source** ‚Äî use USB for the ESP32 separately.
* ‚úÖ **Make sure ESP32 GND is connected to matrix GND** to avoid logic signal errors.
* ‚úÖ Only turn on the panel power once everything is wired.
