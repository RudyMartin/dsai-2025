The introduction of Rule  Constraints is is an **incredible opportunity** to simulate *real-time systems governance* and teach students:

- ⚖️ How constraints drive system design  
- 🧠 How data informs decisions  
- 📣 How to make evidence-based challenges  
- ✅ How to **manage risk and justify override decisions**

# 🚀 **Flight Rule Management (Simulated NASA System)**  
> These rules govern **what teams are allowed to do**, based on environmental, logistic, and mission constraints.  
They are used by **Orion Alpha** (or Beta) to **approve, block, or flag actions** — and teams can *appeal or propose overrides* based on data.

## 🛑 FLIGHT RULES (Dynamic — changeable by Orion)

| # | Rule | Applies To | Condition |
|---|------|------------|-----------|
| 1 | No humans on Deck A if light > 70% | Nova → Vega Alpha | Bright conditions can damage eyes / simulate overexposure |
| 2 | Reject object if no class confidence > 60% | Nova Beta | Avoid acting on low-confidence predictions |
| 3 | Do not open hatch if temp > 30°C | Vega Alpha | Overheat warning in simulation |
| 4 | No food to Deck C if light > 80% | Nova Alpha | Simulate food spoilage from exposure |
| 5 | Limit Deck B to 2 robots per flight | Orion Alpha | Simulate congestion or power overload |
| 6 | If 2 consecutive flights failed, auto-dock | Orion Alpha | Mission safety fallback |
| 7 | Reject all objects if system ping fails | Orion Beta | Simulate comms blackout |
| 8 | Delay next object if NXT system not reset | Nova Alpha | Prevent servo overlap failure |
| 9 | Only allow object if Vega sensors have logged in last 60 sec | Nova Alpha / Beta | Require live data for entry permission |
|10 | Require override note if object is hand-inserted manually | All teams | Catch manual testing or unintended behavior |
|11 | Log critical alert if Deck A hits 90% capacity | Orion Alpha | Forecast threshold trigger |
|12 | Must run “Flight Technician Check” before Flight 3 | All teams | Simulate formal pre-flight inspection

## ✋ CHALLENGES & OVERRIDES

Teams can submit a **Flight Rule Override Request** like this:

### 📝 Sample Challenge:
> **Rule 1:** “No humans on Deck A if light > 70%”  
📣 **Vega Alpha reports light is at 78% — unsafe**  
🛠️ **Nova Alpha responds:** “We’ve added a LEGO shade panel reducing direct light — object should be allowed.”

📊 Orion Alpha reviews log entries from Vega + confirms shade install  
✅ **Override approved**

## 💡 Optional Tools This Suggests

| Tool | Use |
|------|-----|
| Printed “Rule Cards” | Hand to Orion — one per rule with ID + condition |
| Override Forms | Students fill in: “Which rule? What’s the justification?” |
| Rule Tracker Sheet | Tracks how many overrides were requested + approved |
| Rule of the Day | Introduce 1 new rule each morning to simulate changing mission demands
