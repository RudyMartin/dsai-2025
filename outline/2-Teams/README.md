Team Overview: Contains documents detailing which team you belong to (Nova, Vega, Orion) and what your team’s focus will be.

Team Resources: The specific mission your team will work on and any hardware or software you will be using.

Team Roles: Specific tasks and responsibilities for each student within your team.


🛰️ **Recommended Team Structure**

> Mission Group	Teams  are  3-5 students paired based on skills for mission.

**Team Nova – Vision AI Systems**
<ul/>  🔹 Nova Alpha (camera → ESP32)</ul>
<ul/>  🔹 Nova Beta (camera → Pi 5 + dashboard)</ul>

**Team Vega – Sensor Monitoring**	
<ul/>  🔹 Vega Alpha (sensors → Wi-Fi logs)</ul>
<ul/>  🔹 Vega Beta (sensors → direct display/OLED)</ul>

**Team Orion – System Command + Sync**
<ul/>  🔹 Orion Alpha (NAS sync for logs)</ul>
<ul/>  🔹 Orion Beta (peer-to-peer messaging or MQTT)</ul>

🧪 **Strategy Pair Examples**


|Challenge	|Alpha Strategy	|Beta Strategy|
|-----------|--------------|--------------|
|Deploying object detection	|Run model on ESP32 (micro inference)	|Run model on Pi (full inference)|
|Logging sensor data	|Save to NAS via Pi	|Transmit via local Wi-Fi (UDP or REST API)|
|User interface	|OLED/LED indicators	|Flask dashboard on Pi|
|Coordination	|Use shared NAS logs	|Use direct messaging between devices|
|Efficiency	|Optimize for low power	|Optimize for accuracy|
