üõ∞Ô∏è Team Nova Beta ‚Äì Object Detection + Logging with Display (ESP32-S3)
With Camera Integration ‚Äì Updated for Extra Cameras

üéØ Mission Role
Classify LEGO objects using onboard AI and display the result on a dashboard (LED/OLED).
Log predictions and camera snapshots for review by Orion and Vega teams.

üß™ Expanded System Components
Component	Task
Camera (USB/CSI)	Capture image for classification and logging
Model (TFLite)	Predict object class (e.g., Tool, Food, Supply)
Display (OLED)	Show object class in real-time (e.g., ‚ÄúFOOD ‚Äì Deck C‚Äù)
Logger	Save prediction + image ref + timestamp to shared directory
Orion Sync	Orion uses this data for forecasting deck loading trends

üîÅ Interaction Flow (Expanded with Camera)
Student places object

ESP32-S3 captures image via camera

Model predicts: Tool

Display shows: ‚ÄúTOOL ‚Äì Deck B‚Äù

Snapshot and prediction logged:
{timestamp, object: Tool, image: tool_004.jpg}

Orion & Vega use logs for deck state forecasts and validations

‚è±Ô∏è Feasibility with Camera ‚Äì 5-Day Plan
Day	Activities
Day 1	‚úÖ Camera setup test (frame + exposure) + OLED check
Day 2	‚úÖ Integrate model + verify predictions with camera input
Day 3	‚úÖ Build dashboard interface + finalize image + text logging
Day 4	‚úÖ Sync logs to shared location for Orion + capture 5‚Äì10 sample detections
Day 5	‚úÖ Polish display, confirm Orion sees predictions, prep demo

üõ†Ô∏è Design Constraints
Camera images must be timestamped and logged

OLED must show prediction visibly for crew

Logs must be readable by Orion, and saved in .csv or .json with image reference

üí° Optional Enhancements
Record confidence score and include fallback prediction if low confidence

Add a status LED for "success" or "error"

Trigger sound for specific object types (e.g., buzzer for ‚ÄúF

## üõ∞Ô∏è Team Nova Beta ‚Äì Full Object Detection + Logging System (Raspberry Pi 5)

---

### 1. üéØ **Mission Role**  
> Run full object detection models (TFLite or ONNX) on the Raspberry Pi 5.  
Capture each object type and **log predictions**, **display classification**, and **sync results** to shared flight logs used by Vega and Orion teams for decisions.  
This team is the **"vision AI with dashboard"** counterpart to Nova Alpha‚Äôs edge actuator.

---

### 2. üß± **LEGO Build Purpose**  
Build a **structured object analysis station** where students can place LEGO objects for classification.  
- Mounted camera captures images under consistent lighting  
- LED screen or Pi dashboard displays predicted object class  
- Optional: robotic turntable (with NXT servo) for object reveal or rotation  
- No routing action here ‚Äî this team is the **observer/logger**, not the router

---

### 3. üß∞ **Required LEGO + Hardware Parts**

| Type | Qty | Purpose |
|------|-----|---------|
| LEGO baseplate | 1 | Presentation platform |
| LEGO bricks/objects (3‚Äì5 classes) | 8‚Äì12 | For model training/testing |
| Technic frame | 10‚Äì15 | Secure camera or sensor positioning |
| Raspberry Pi 5 (8GB) | 1 | Runs full model inference |
| CSI/USB camera | 1 | Connected to Pi |
| LED/OLED display or Pi screen | 1 | Shows prediction to student |
| Flask dashboard template | 1 | Optional web UI for classification log |
| Optional: NXT servo motor | 1 | Rotates object for camera view |

---

### 4. üß™ **AI + Data Science System Actions**

| Component | Task |
|----------|------|
| **Roboflow-trained model (full TFLite/ONNX)** | Classifies incoming object |
| **Python script** | Logs prediction + timestamp |
| **Flask web dashboard** | Displays latest classification + object image |
| **Flight manifest integration** | Logs to shared directory for Orion review |
| **Prediction accuracy checks** | Manual or automated comparison to manifest or instructor key  
| **Optional: Top-2 confidence logic** | Classify fallback when confidence < threshold

---

### 5. üîÅ **Interaction Flow (with Space Deck + Forecast Tie-In)**

```plaintext
Student places object on deck ‚Üí
Pi captures image ‚Üí
Model predicts: ‚Äòfood‚Äô ‚Üí
Display shows: ‚ÄúFOOD ‚Äì Deck C‚Äù ‚Üí
Log written to NAS: {timestamp, object: food, predicted_deck: C} ‚Üí
Orion pulls logs and forecasts deck fill state
```

- Vega might use the result to decide if the deck is ready (e.g., temp for food is too high)
- Orion may trigger a **docking warning** if too many objects are forecasted to Deck C

---

### 6. ‚è±Ô∏è **Feasibility in 5-Day Camp**

‚úÖ Yes, and great for students with:
- Interest in dashboards, data logs, or Python scripting
- Day 1: Flask setup + camera test
- Day 2: Full model integration + object display
- Day 3: Log format finalized + NAS sync
- Day 4: Forecast-aware classification logic
- Day 5: Dashboard + final demo polish

---

### üõ†Ô∏è **Design Constraint: Inter-Team Integration Required**

> ‚ú® Your system must **log each detection to a shared flight record**, so that:
> - Vega can check if the object should be allowed (e.g., food vs deck light level)
> - Orion can **forecast overloads** (e.g., ‚ÄúDeck C has had 4 food objects this flight‚Äù)

**You are the eyes of the mission ‚Äî your logs must be complete, consistent, and readable by others.**
