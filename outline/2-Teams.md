🛰️ Recommended Team Structure

Mission Group	Teams
Team Nova – Vision AI Systems	🔹 Nova Alpha (camera → ESP32)
🔹 Nova Beta (camera → Pi 5 + dashboard)
Team Vega – Sensor Monitoring	🔹 Vega Alpha (sensors → Wi-Fi logs)
🔹 Vega Beta (sensors → direct display/OLED)
Team Orion – System Command + Sync	🔹 Orion Alpha (NAS sync for logs)
🔹 Orion Beta (peer-to-peer messaging or MQTT)
🧪 Strategy Pair Examples

Challenge	Alpha Strategy	Beta Strategy
Deploying object detection	Run model on ESP32 (micro inference)	Run model on Pi (full inference)
Logging sensor data	Save to NAS via Pi	Transmit via local Wi-Fi (UDP or REST API)
User interface	OLED/LED indicators	Flask dashboard on Pi
Coordination	Use shared NAS logs	Use direct messaging between devices
Efficiency	Optimize for low power	Optimize for accuracy
🎓 Teaching Bonus
Frame it like this:

“NASA always tests multiple mission strategies in parallel. Your Alpha and Beta teams are two paths to the same goal. Which one gets there faster? Which one uses less power? Which one recovers better from failure?”

Would you like a Mission Packet template that assigns:

Roles per team

Evaluation goals (efficiency, accuracy, battery use, etc.)

Deliverables

Optional scoring rubric?

I can also generate team logos or patch icons for Alpha/Beta variations.
