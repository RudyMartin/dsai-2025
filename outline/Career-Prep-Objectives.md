**Framing the Objectives**

I'm starting to build out the summer camp learning objectives. The key focus right now is clearly defining the audience and the context of the camp to tailor the goals effectively. I'm considering the high schoolers' prior knowledge and the summer environment to inform what's achievable.


**Mapping the Curriculum**

I've broken down the "Core Deep Learning & Problem Solving" skills into core components. Thinking about the Deep Learning Fundamentals, I am focusing on practical applications. For LLMs, Transformers, and fine-tuning, I am trying to balance theoretical depth with engagement, ensuring a grasp of their real-world utility, while considering the time constraints of a summer camp.


**Refining Learning Objectives**

I'm now working on translating the detailed skill breakdowns into learning objectives for the high schoolers. I'm aiming for simplicity and engagement. For example, for video AI, I've reframed the concepts of object detection and classification into questions like "How do self-driving cars see?" and I am thinking about how the students might apply these.


**Revising and Simplifying**

I'm now iterating on the student-facing objectives, aiming for simplicity. I'm ensuring the language is accessible and the concepts are connected to everyday examples. Furthermore, I've incorporated activities that promote engagement, such as hands-on application of pre-trained models to give the students direct experience with AI.


**Defining Student Objectives**

I'm now formulating learning objectives for the students, building on the previous foundation. I'm aiming for simple language and real-world connections, and I'm currently working on incorporating hands-on applications of pre-trained models to give the students practical experience with AI and enhance their understanding.


**Defining Specific Outcomes**

I'm now distilling the raw skills into tangible objectives. My current focus is crafting measurable outcomes for each module, aiming for clarity and student engagement. I'm prioritizing hands-on activities that let students actively apply their newfound knowledge.


**Synthesizing the Outcomes**

I'm now reviewing the proposed learning objectives, assessing their clarity and alignment with the high schoolers' needs. I'm focusing on the hands-on activities and ensuring the concepts connect back to real-world examples. I'm iterating on the phrasing, ensuring that the objectives are both measurable and engaging, and that students can actively apply their new knowledge.


Okay, transforming those into learning objectives suitable for a high school summer camp requires simplifying the language, focusing on conceptual understanding and hands-on application rather than deep theoretical dives, and making them measurable.

Here are the learning objectives for "Core Deep Learning & Problem Solving" at a high school summer camp:

---

**Summer Camp Track: Unleashing AI Power: Core Concepts & Smart Solutions**

**Overarching Goal:** By the end of this camp, students will understand how Artificial Intelligence learns and "thinks," and develop fundamental problem-solving skills to build and troubleshoot their own AI projects.

**Learning Objectives:**

**I. Core Deep Learning Fundamentals: Making Computers "Smart"**

*   **Understanding How AI Sees (Video AI):**
    *   Students will be able to **explain** how computers can identify objects, track movement, and understand actions in videos (like in self-driving cars or security cameras).
    *   Students will **identify** common tasks that AI performs in video analysis, such as "object detection" and "classification," and **recognize** their real-world applications.
    *   *Hands-on:* Students will **apply** a pre-trained AI model to perform basic object detection on sample images or videos.

*   **Understanding How AI Talks (Large Language Models):**
    *   Students will be able to **describe** what a "Large Language Model" (LLM) is and its basic function (e.g., generating text, answering questions).
    *   Students will **experiment with** "prompt engineering" by crafting effective instructions to guide AI models to produce desired text or responses.
    *   Students will **understand** the concept of "fine-tuning" â€“ how a general AI model can be adapted to become an expert in a specific topic using a small amount of new information.

*   **Making AI Models Nimble (Optimization Basics):**
    *   Students will **explain** why it's important to make AI models small and fast, especially for use on devices like phones or in real-time applications.
    *   Students will **identify** simple techniques like "quantization" (making AI models use less memory) and "pruning" (trimming unnecessary parts) that help speed up AI.

*   **Packaging AI for Success (Model Formats):**
    *   Students will **understand** the need for common ways to "package" AI models (like using a universal file format) so they can be easily used in different applications or on different devices.
    *   *Hands-on:* Students will **perform** a basic conversion of a simple AI model into a deployment-ready format.

**II. Problem Solving for AI Builders: Fixing & Improving**

*   **Becoming an AI Detective (Debugging & Troubleshooting):**
    *   Students will be able to **identify** common reasons why an AI model might give incorrect answers or why an AI program might stop working.
    *   Students will **apply** basic debugging strategies (e.g., checking inputs, understanding error messages) to troubleshoot and **solve** simple issues in AI code or model outputs.
    *   *Hands-on:* Students will be given "broken" AI code or models and challenged to **find and fix** the errors.

*   **Boosting AI's Speed (Performance Tuning):**
    *   Students will **measure** how fast a given AI model performs a task and **identify** what might be slowing it down (like complex instructions or too much data).
    *   Students will **propose** and **implement** simple adjustments to make an AI model run faster or more efficiently without losing much accuracy.
    *   *Hands-on:* Students will **compare** the performance of two different versions of an AI model and **optimize** one for speed.

*   **Teamwork in AI (Collaboration):**
    *   Students will **collaborate effectively** with their peers on a team project to build or refine an AI application.
    *   Students will **communicate** their ideas, challenges, and solutions clearly with their team members.
    *   Students will **contribute** to a shared goal, recognizing that successful AI development often involves diverse skills working together.
