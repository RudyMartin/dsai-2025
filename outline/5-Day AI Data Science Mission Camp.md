## 🗓️ **DAY 1 – Mission Bootcamp + Tech Systems Go**

**Theme:** *"Welcome to the crew"*

| Block | Activity |
|-------|----------|
| 🚀 Kickoff Briefing | Mission intro, team roles, what is a model? |
| 🧠 Mini Python Lab | ESP32 script editing, Pi dashboard intro |
| 🧪 Roboflow Station | Train first model on LEGO samples |
| 🔌 Tech Bootcamp Rotations | ESP32 test, camera, sensor wiring, NXT motor test |
| ⚙️ Optional: Colab warm-up | For advanced students or downtime |

> ✅ Teams leave with working base models + hardware checks passed

---

## 🗓️ **DAY 2 – Physical Build + First Flight**

**Theme:** *"Building the Space Deck"*

| Block | Activity |
|-------|----------|
| 🧱 LEGO/NXT Build Time | Create physical decks, test movement, gates |
| 🔁 Integration Test | Connect ESP32, sensors, NXT motion |
| ✈️ **Flight 1 Simulation** | 3–5 objects per team |
| 📊 Reflection: Logs + Debrief | What failed? What misclassified? What log is missing? |

> ✅ All teams complete their first full detection-to-action pipeline

---

## 🗓️ **DAY 3 – Mid-Mission Tuning + Flight Pressure**

**Theme:** *"Adapt or fail"*

| Block | Activity |
|-------|----------|
| 🔄 Forecast Lab (Orion-led) | Predict which decks will overload |
| ✈️ **Flight 2** – With constraints | E.g., “Deck A offline” or “unexpected cargo ratio” |
| 🛠️ Midday Repair + Upgrade Sprint | Improve code, reroute logic, new detection model |
| ✈️ **Flight 3** – With speed limit | Must process in time windows (log when delayed) |
| 📊 DS Recap: Talk through models, errors, sensor logs |

> ✅ Teams iterate AND think like data scientists: model → test → fix

---

## 🗓️ **DAY 4 – Final Flight + Startup Simulation**

**Theme:** *"You are the AI engineers now"*

| Block | Activity |
|-------|----------|
| ✨ Add prediction logic | e.g., “Trigger docking in 2 flights if no space” |
| ✈️ **Final Simulation Flight** | Full load, full logs, all systems running |
| 📈 Final Dashboard Review | Forecasting, deck usage, accuracy charts |
| 🎤 Begin Presentation Prep | Team slides, role summaries, demo screenshots |
| 🛠️ Freeze codebases | Save final builds, zip logs for parents/judges |

> ✅ Systems finalized + stories ready to be told

---

## 🗓️ **DAY 5 – Showcase & Presentations (AM Polish + PM Online)**

**Theme:** *"Report back to Earth"*

| Block | Activity |
|-------|----------|
| 🧼 Morning Polish Time | Final bug fixes, test demo, team rehearsal |
| 🎥 Practice Run | Run a 2-minute dry pitch: what did we build? what did it do? what did we learn? |
| 🎤 **1:00 PM Online Showcase** | Parents + guests join on Zoom |
| 🏆 Awards: Best Prediction, Best Integration, Most Creative, etc. |
| 👋 Farewell + Future Learning Resources |
