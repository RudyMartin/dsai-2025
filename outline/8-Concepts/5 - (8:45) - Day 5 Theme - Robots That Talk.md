## ðŸ§­ Day 5: Multi-Agent Simulation â€“ "Robots That Talk"

### ðŸŽ¯ Mission Objective

Simulate agents sharing status and collaborating to make decisions.

### ðŸ§  Learning Objectives

* Simulate multiple roles (e.g., robot, forecast, deck monitor)
* Send and receive JSON-formatted messages
* Plan for distributed agent behavior

### ðŸ”§ Key Activities

* Use `Serial.print()` to simulate messages between agents
* Design a simple message protocol (e.g., `{deck: C, status: full}`)
* Combine decisions from multiple "agents"

### ðŸ“š Vocabulary

* Multi-agent system
* Message passing
* Coordination protocol

### ðŸ’¬ Discussion Prompt

"How does your robot make a better decision when it talks to its teammates first?"
