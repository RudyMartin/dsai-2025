Day 3: Movement and Control Logic
Learn Sessions:
3C2 – Learn – Advanced Models II

Purpose: Likely focuses on model refinement, possibly motion prediction.

Supports: 3E Motion detection, conveyor design.

3G – Learn – Optimization and Tuning

Purpose: Introduce hyperparameters, model tuning basics.

Supports: Reinforces improvements on robotic behavior, sensor routing.

Labs:
Lab 5: Motion detection → physical actuation (conveyor).

Lab 6: Start of group projects.

✅ Overall Fit: Strong logic but would benefit from clarification of Learn II scope.
📚 Suggested Learn Additions:

Demo: Show poor vs. tuned model predictions.

Coding: Interactive sliders to tweak values and see effects on classification/response speed.

Day 4: Sensors, Panels, and Debugging
Learn Sessions:
4B – Learn – Presentation Rules and Resources

Supports: Prepares for final demos and project storytelling.

4C – Panel – Career Opportunities

Supports: Expands on real-world relevance.

Labs:
Group Project II: Running first trials.

Group Project III: Debugging + sensor fusion.

⚠️ Needs Clarification: No technical "Learn" linked directly to debugging or sensor fusion.
📚 Suggested Learn Additions:

Add short “debugging mindset” session: How to log outputs, common wiring bugs, basic troubleshooting checklist.

Show how different sensors can be combined (e.g., motion + light + temp).

Day 5: Polish and Present
Learn Sessions:
None formally marked "Learn" on Day 5.

5I – Topic Video – Inspiration

Labs:
Group Project IV + V: Final wrap-up + presentation prep.

Zoom Showcase

⚠️ Could Add Light Learn Content:

Brief mini-lecture: “How to communicate your project” or “What judges want to see”.

Include a checklist or rubric review for final presentation.
