# ESP32-S3 + Camera + Agentic Robotics Camp



## ðŸ§­ Day 4: Sensor-Aware Agents â€“ "React to the World"

### ðŸŽ¯ Mission Objective

Respond to environmental conditions: donâ€™t just decide â€” adapt.

### ðŸ§  Learning Objectives

* Read from temp, humidity, or light sensors
* Combine sensor values with classification to inform decision
* Use sensor fusion for smarter routing

### ðŸ”§ Key Activities

* Connect temp/humidity/light sensors
* Create compound conditions (`if temp > 30 && color == Red`)
* Simulate edge case scenarios (e.g., path too dark)

### ðŸ“š Vocabulary

* Sensor fusion
* Threshold
* Environmental adaptation
