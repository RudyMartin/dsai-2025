Mission Brief: Tag-Along Python Exercise
Just like astronauts follow a mission checklist together, we’re going to do this next part as a team. This is a tag-along exercise—you don’t need to be a Python expert yet! We’ll go step-by-step, and you can follow along with me.

Let’s Log in to Google Colab
Open your browser and go to [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/).

Sign in with your individual Google account (not a school account) if you aren’t already.

Once you’re in, we’ll start a new notebook and follow the instructions together.

What Are We Doing?
We’ll see how to use Python code to interact with a RAG chatbot.

You’ll upload a set of study notes or use a sample document.

We’ll ask the chatbot questions and see how it gives answers based on your notes—not just random internet info.

Why Do This?
You’ll get hands-on experience with Python, Colab, and AI tools—skills that are super valuable for your future.

You’ll see how AI can be used responsibly to help you learn, not just give you answers.

And if you get stuck, don’t worry—we’re all on the same mission, and I’ll help guide you through each step.

Ready? Let’s launch our Colab notebooks and start exploring together!
