## ðŸ§­ Day 3: Memory + Routing Logic â€“ "Smarter Decisions"

### ðŸŽ¯ Mission Objective

Track and adapt based on system state (e.g., deck load).

### ðŸ§  Learning Objectives

* Implement counters or arrays to track object counts
* Use conditional rules to reroute based on state (e.g., Deck B full)
* Simulate decision trees based on multiple conditions

### ðŸ”§ Key Activities

* Add deck counters in code
* Modify `if/else` logic to use counters
* Print routing decisions via `Serial.println()`

### ðŸ“š Vocabulary

* State variable
* Counter / accumulator
* Reroute logic

### ðŸ’¬ Discussion Prompt

"What if the robot has to decide between two bad options? How should it choose?"
