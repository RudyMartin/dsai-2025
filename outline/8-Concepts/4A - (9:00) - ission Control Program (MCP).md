## 🚀 **Mission Control Program (MCP)**

**"Can a chatbot become a real-time AI assistant?"**

### 🎯 Learning Goal:

Introduce students to **LLMs** (Large Language Models) as decision-makers that can process input from sensors, interpret it, and respond like an intelligent teammate.

---

### 🔍 **Why This Matters**

* Real missions (like space or Mars rovers) use **central brains** to coordinate parts.
* LLMs can act like a **thinking agent** that reads sensor inputs and chooses what to do — like rerouting objects or alerting when heat levels spike.

### 🔧 Setup:

| What You Need                          | Purpose                                 |
| -------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| **ESP32-S3 + sensor (e.g., temp)**     | Provides real-world data                |
| **Chatbot (LLM) Interface (Mocked)**   | Takes input, returns "advice" or action |
| **Student Script (Python or Arduino)** | Formats sensor values into messages     |
| **LLM Prompt Template**                | Tells AI how to "think" and reply       |

### 💡 **Activity Outline:**

1. **Introduce the Concept**
   What is a Mission Control Program? How does it compare to a chatbot?

2. **Sensor → Message**
   Students wire up a temp or light sensor. If it's too hot, the ESP sends a message like:
   `{"sensor": "temp", "value": 38}`

3. **LLM Prompting (in pairs)**
   Use a simple prompt:
   `"If temp > 35, advise cooling. Else, continue operations."`
   Simulate LLM response:
   `"Warning: Deck C temperature critical. Initiate fan."`

4. **Design Challenge**
   Teams design 1–2 sample prompts where the LLM must decide what the robot arm should do based on conditions.

### 📘 Mission Connection:

* **Nova**: This could be a bonus enhancement — logging sensor warnings.
* **Vega**: Perfect for adding feedback intelligence (temp, object class, urgency).
* **Orion**: MCP becomes the coordinating brain across agents.

### 🧠 Learning Outcomes:

✅ Understand how LLMs can reason with sensor input
✅ Practice formatting structured input (JSON or plain text)
✅ Recognize the role of intelligent decision systems in real missions
✅ Begin designing “thinking systems” with natural language
