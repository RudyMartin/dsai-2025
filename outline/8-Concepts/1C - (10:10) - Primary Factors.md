The AI programs making NFL draft predictions considered several key factors in their picks:

- **1. Player Performance Data:** AI relies heavily on vast amounts of player statistics, college performance metrics, and historical data to assess talent and project future success. The more comprehensive and high-quality the data, the better the AI's predictions[5].

- **2. Team Needs and Draft Trends:** Algorithms analyze each NFL team’s roster, recent performance, and positional needs. They also factor in historical draft trends—such as which positions are typically prioritized by certain teams—to make context-aware predictions[5].

- **3. Machine Learning Algorithms:** The type of machine learning algorithm used is critical. Supervised learning is common, where the AI is trained on past drafts and learns to recognize patterns in team behavior and player selection. Regression and classification techniques help estimate player value and predict draft order[1].

- **4. Pattern Recognition and Forecasting:** AI platforms excel at identifying patterns in large datasets, such as which player profiles are most likely to be picked early or which teams are likely to trade up. Forecasting models use historical data to predict future outcomes, such as a player’s likelihood of being selected in a certain draft range[1][5].

- **5. Adaptation and Learning:** Modern AI systems continuously learn from new data, adapting their predictions as more information becomes available (e.g., updated mock drafts, team trades, or injury news)[5].

- **6. Objectivity and Bias Reduction:** AI aims to minimize human bias by making decisions based on data-driven insights, leading to more objective and fair results[5].

In summary, the AI programs used a combination of player data, team needs, historical trends, and sophisticated machine learning algorithms to make their picks, always learning and adapting as new information emerged[1][5].
