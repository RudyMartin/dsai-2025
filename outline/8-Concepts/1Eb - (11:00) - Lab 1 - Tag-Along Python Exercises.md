## **Mission Brief: Tag-Along Python Exercise**

Just like astronauts follow a mission checklist together, we’re going to do this next part as a team. This is a **tag-along exercise**—you don’t need to be a Python expert yet! We’ll go step-by-step, and you can follow along with me.

### **Let’s Log in to Google Colab**

1. **Open your browser and go to [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/).**
2. **Sign in with your individual Google account if you aren’t already.**
3. **Once you’re in, we’ll start a new notebook and follow the instructions together.**

### **What Are We Doing?**

- We’ll see how to use Python code to interact with a RAG chatbot.
- You’ll upload a set of study notes or use a sample document.
- We’ll ask the chatbot questions and see how it gives answers based on your notes—not just random internet info.

---

### **Why Do This?**

- You’ll get hands-on experience with Python, Colab, and AI tools—skills that are super valuable for your future.
- You’ll see how AI can be used responsibly to help you learn, not just give you answers.
- And if you get stuck, don’t worry—we’re all on the same mission, and I’ll help guide you through each step.

**Ready? Let’s launch our Colab notebooks and start exploring together!**
