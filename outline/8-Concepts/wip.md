Here‚Äôs a structured **review of the five-day camp sessions** based on the parsed schedule. 
I‚Äôve evaluated **flow**, **consistency**, and **coverage across days**, and highlighted potential **gaps, redundancies, or sequencing issues**.

---

### ‚úÖ **General Flow Check**

Each day follows a consistent pattern:

* üåÖ **Morning preview / theme**
* üìò **Learning or discussion**
* üî¨ **Lab-based activity**
* üß† **Group or mission work**
* üîÅ **Debrief + next steps**

This is a **strong structure** that encourages progressive skill-building and reflection. Now let's drill into the **day-by-day flow** and identify areas to review or improve.
