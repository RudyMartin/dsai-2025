TODO: Revise this to simplify steps

Defining a clear, consistent labeling concept is **crucial** for successful model training and reliable object detection/classification. Let's break down the process and agree on a labeling scheme tailored for your Lego Star Wars minifigures arranged by color, size, and style.

---

## 1. **Labeling Concept: Multi-Class Structure**

Since you want to classify by **color**, **size**, and **style**, each minifigure can be described by a combination of these attributes. For example, a label might be:  
`red_small_jedi`

### **Attribute Categories**

- **Color:** e.g., red, blue, black, white, yellow, green, etc.
- **Size:** e.g., small, medium, large (or short, standard, tall if more appropriate for minifigures)
- **Style:** e.g., jedi, sith, mandalorian, trooper, droid, etc.

---

## 2. **Label Format**

There are two common approaches:

### **A. Combined Class Label (Recommended for Simpler Models)**
Each unique combination is a single class label:
- `red_small_jedi`
- `blue_large_sith`
- `black_medium_trooper`
- ...etc.

**Pros:**  
- Simple for most embedded ML models  
- Direct mapping to seating/placement

**Cons:**  
- Number of classes grows rapidly with more attribute values

### **B. Multi-Label (Attribute-Wise)**
Each image gets three labels (one for each attribute):
- Color: red
- Size: small
- Style: jedi

**Pros:**  
- More flexible, especially if you want to generalize or mix attributes
- Easier to add new attributes later

**Cons:**  
- Requires multi-output models, which are more complex and may not fit on ESP32

---

## 3. **Recommended Labeling for Your Use Case**

Given the ESP32's constraints and your need to map directly to seating patterns, **Combined Class Labeling** is the most practical.

### **Example Label List**

If you have:
- 6 colors
- 3 sizes
- 6 styles

Total classes = 6 × 3 × 6 = **108 classes**

Each image is labeled as one of these 108 classes, e.g.:
- `red_small_jedi`
- `blue_large_sith`
- `black_medium_trooper`
- `white_large_droid`
- ...and so on.

---

## 4. **Labeling Tool & Format**

- Use a tool like [LabelImg](https://github.com/tzutalin/labelImg) or [Roboflow](https://roboflow.com/) for image annotation.
- Save labels in YOLO or COCO format (both are supported by Edge Impulse and other ML platforms).

**Example (YOLO format):**
```
class_id x_center y_center width height
```
Where `class_id` is the index of your combined label in your master list.

---

## 5. **Seating Pattern Mapping**

Since you have a specific seating pattern (6 groups of 18 in 3 rows), you can create a lookup table:
```python
seat_pattern = [
    ["red_small_jedi", "blue_large_sith", ...],  # Row 1
    ["black_medium_trooper", ...],               # Row 2
    ...
]
```
During inference, detected class labels are mapped to their expected positions for verification.

---

## 6. **Next Steps**

1. **Finalize attribute values** (list all possible colors, sizes, and styles).
2. **Create a master class list** (all possible combinations).
3. **Label your dataset** using the agreed format.
4. **Share the seating pattern** (if you want help with the lookup table or mapping logic).

---

**Does this combined label approach work for you?**  
If you want to use multi-label instead, or if you have a different idea, let me know and we can adjust! Please provide your finalized attribute lists and any special considerations for labeling.

Answer from Perplexity: pplx.ai/share

The ten primary color levels, in order, are:

Black (0)

Brown (1)

Red (2)

Orange (3)

Yellow (4)

Green (5)

Blue (6)

Violet (7) (sometimes called purple)

Gray (8) (or grey)

White (9)

Great! Let’s define a clear **position numbering system** for your Lego Star Wars minifigures, using 3 rows and 6 spaces per row. This will help with both labeling your training images and mapping detected minifigures to their assigned travel positions.

---

## **Position Numbering Convention**

**Rows:** 1, 2, 3  
**Spaces per row:** 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6

### **Position Label Format**

You can use a simple format:
```
Row_Space
```
For example:
- Row1_Space1
- Row1_Space2
- ...
- Row2_Space1
- ...
- Row3_Space6

Or, if you prefer a compact format:
- R1S1, R1S2, ..., R3S6

---

### **Full List of Positions**

| Row | Spaces         |
|-----|---------------|
| 1   | 1 2 3 4 5 6   |
| 2   | 1 2 3 4 5 6   |
| 3   | 1 2 3 4 5 6   |

**Total positions:** 3 rows × 6 spaces = **18 positions**

---

### **Example Mapping Table**

| Position Label | Description         |
|:--------------:|:-------------------|
| Row1_Space1    | Row 1, Space 1     |
| Row1_Space2    | Row 1, Space 2     |
| ...            | ...                |
| Row2_Space1    | Row 2, Space 1     |
| ...            | ...                |
| Row3_Space6    | Row 3, Space 6     |

---

### **How to Use This in Your Project**

- **Image Labeling:** When labeling your images, include both the minifigure’s class (e.g., color/size/style) and its position (Row and Space).
    - Example: `red_small_jedi_Row1_Space1`
- **Seating Pattern:** You can create a 2D array or table in your code to represent the expected arrangement.
    - Example (Python-style pseudocode):
      ```python
      seating_pattern = [
          ["R1S1", "R1S2", "R1S3", "R1S4", "R1S5", "R1S6"],
          ["R2S1", "R2S2", "R2S3", "R2S4", "R2S5", "R2S6"],
          ["R3S1", "R3S2", "R3S3", "R3S4", "R3S5", "R3S6"]
      ]
      ```

---

**Next Steps:**
1. Confirm this numbering scheme works for you.
2. If so, we can proceed to combine this with your color/size/style labeling and build a full labeling format for your dataset and model training.

Let me know if you’d like to adjust the numbering or move to the next step!
