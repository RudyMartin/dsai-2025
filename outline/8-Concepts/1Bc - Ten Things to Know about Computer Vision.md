## 🧠 Ten Things to Know about Computer Vision

### 📸 A Topic Guide for High School Data Science Students

---

### 1. **What Is Computer Vision?**

* It’s how computers “see” and understand images or videos.
* Example: Face recognition on your phone.

---

### 2. **Pixels Are the Language of Images**

* Images are made of tiny dots called **pixels**.
* Each pixel has color values (like Red, Green, Blue).
* Computers read these numbers to interpret what they see.

---

### 3. **Image Classification: Name That Object**

* The computer looks at a picture and says what’s in it.
* Example: “This is a cat.”
* Tools used: **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)**.

---

### 4. **Object Detection: Find and Label Multiple Things**

* Goes beyond naming—shows where each object is.
* Example: Boxes around “person,” “bicycle,” “dog.”
* Used in self-driving cars, security cameras.

---

### 5. **Training a Vision Model**

* Computers learn by looking at thousands of labeled examples.
* Process: Input Image → Prediction → Check → Improve.
* Students can train simple models using platforms like **Teachable Machine** or **Roboflow**.

---

### 6. **Data Is Everything**

* The quality of your model depends on your data.
* You need:

  * **Enough images**
  * **Variety** (different lighting, angles)
  * **Clean labels**

---

### 7. **Pre-trained Models Save Time**

* You don’t always have to train from scratch.
* Use models like:

  * **YOLO (You Only Look Once)**
  * **MobileNet**
  * **ResNet**
* These are like giving your project a “head start.”

---

### 8. **How Vision Models Make Mistakes**

* Confuse similar things (muffin vs. chihuahua).
* Struggle with blurry or dark images.
* Can be biased if trained with limited data.

---

### 9. **Tiny Vision Models for Edge Devices**

* You can run vision on small computers like the **ESP32**, **Raspberry Pi**, or phones.
* Great for science fairs, robotics, or smart gadgets.
* These use **TinyML** and **TFLite** (TensorFlow Lite).

---

### 10. **Cool Real-World Projects**

* Detect trash on beaches 🌊
* Count cars on roads 🚗
* Sort LEGO bricks by color 🔴🟢🔵
* Recognize gestures or sign language 🤟
