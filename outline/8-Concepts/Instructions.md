## **1. ESP32-Driven Conveyor Belt with Object Recognition**

- **Conveyor System:**  
  The conveyor belt is powered by a motor (usually a DC or stepper motor) and controlled by the ESP32. The ESP32 can start, stop, or adjust the speed of the belt as needed[6].

- **Object Recognition:**  
  An **ESP32-CAM module** is positioned above the conveyor belt to capture images of objects as they pass by.  
  - **Machine Vision:** The ESP32-CAM runs a machine learning model (often trained with Edge Impulse) to recognize and classify objects in real time[2][3][4][6][7][8].
  - **Detection Output:** The ESP32 processes the image, determines the object type (e.g., color, shape, or specific item), and can display results on an OLED or send them to the main controller[3][6].

- **Integration Example:**  
  > “The purpose of this system is to sort objects moving on a conveyor belt to two separate containers. The objects are recognized using a machine vision algorithm running locally on an ESP32 camera module.”[4]  
  Some projects use color or shape detection; others use more advanced object recognition models[3][6].

## **2. 4-DOF Arm for Sorting into Bins**

- **Robotic Arm:**  
  A 4-degree-of-freedom (DOF) robotic arm is positioned at the end of the conveyor belt.
  - The arm receives commands from the ESP32 (or a secondary controller) indicating which bin to place the object in, based on the recognition result.

- **Actuation:**  
  The arm is typically driven by servo motors, often managed via a PCA9685 servo driver for precise control.

- **Sorting Logic:**  
  The ESP32 (or main controller) sends the arm the bin number (1–6), and the arm moves the object from the conveyor to the correct bin.

- **Example Flow:**  
  1. Object moves on conveyor.
  2. ESP32-CAM captures and classifies the object.
  3. Conveyor stops (if needed).
  4. 4-DOF arm picks up the object and places it in the correct bin based on classification.

## **Key Technologies & Considerations**

- **ESP32-CAM** for vision and recognition[3][4][6][7][8].
- **Edge Impulse** or similar for training and deploying ML models on the ESP32[2][3][7][8].
- **Servo motors** (for the arm) and **DC/stepper motor** (for conveyor)[6].
- **PCA9685** or similar servo driver for multi-servo control.
- **Synchronized control** between conveyor, camera, and robotic arm.

**In summary:**  
Your project uses an ESP32 and camera for real-time object recognition on a conveyor, then a 4-DOF arm (with servos) to sort objects into one of six bins based on the detected class-mirroring contemporary educational and industrial demo projects[3][4][6].
