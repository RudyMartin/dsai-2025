## 🎯 Transition Goal:

Let's tie the **big picture (TIR + AI robot capabilities)** into the **hands-on lab**, so that we all understand *why* the technical skills matter.

### 🧠 Connect the Concepts

| **Concept from Video**          | **What They’re Doing in Lab 2**                                        |
| ------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Smart, compact robots can "see" | You’ll use sensors and basic models to detect and respond to objects   |
| On-device intelligence          | You're building logic into your hardware directly                      |
| From LLMs to edge computing     | You’re starting with perception, the base layer of intelligent systems |

### 🧩 Warm-Up Prompt 

**Ask:**

> *“If your robot could only recognize 3 objects, what would they be — and what would you want it to do for each one?”*
