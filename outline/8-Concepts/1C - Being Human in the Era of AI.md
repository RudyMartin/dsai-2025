### 📘 **Key Content & Discussion Prompts**

#### 🔹 Basic Terms to Know:

* **AI** – machines that act “smart”
* **Machine Learning (ML)** – how computers learn patterns
* **Data Science** – turning messy data into useful info
* **Agent** – a system that acts in the world (e.g., a chatbot or robot)

#### 🔹 Agent Types (Give one-sentence example for each):

* **Reactive Agent**: Always responds the same (e.g., vending machine)
* **Rule-Based Agent**: Follows if-then rules (e.g., thermostat)
* **Goal-Based Agent**: Takes steps to reach a goal (e.g., robot vacuum)
* **Learning Agent**: Gets better with experience (e.g., TikTok’s algorithm)
