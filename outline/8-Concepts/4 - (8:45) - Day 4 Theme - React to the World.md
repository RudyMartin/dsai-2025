# ESP32-S3 + Camera + Agentic Robotics Camp



## üß≠ Day 4: Sensor-Aware Agents ‚Äì "React to the World"

### üéØ Mission Objective

Respond to environmental conditions: don‚Äôt just decide ‚Äî adapt.

### üß† Learning Objectives

* Read from temp, humidity, or light sensors
* Combine sensor values with classification to inform decision
* Use sensor fusion for smarter routing

### üîß Key Activities

* Connect temp/humidity/light sensors
* Create compound conditions (`if temp > 30 && color == Red`)
* Simulate edge case scenarios (e.g., path too dark)

### üìö Vocabulary

* Sensor fusion
* Threshold
* Environmental adaptation

### üí¨ Discussion Prompt

"How does your robot behave differently if it‚Äôs hot, dark, or damp?"
