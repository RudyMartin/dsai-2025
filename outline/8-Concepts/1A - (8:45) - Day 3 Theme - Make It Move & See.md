## ðŸ§­ Day 3: Setup + First Motion â€“ "Make It Move & See"

### ðŸŽ¯ Mission Objective

Build and test a basic robotic system: camera + servo-controlled robot arm.

### ðŸ§  Learning Objectives

* Understand ESP32-S3 and Arduino IDE setup
* Wire and control servo motors using PCA9685
* Stream live video from the onboard OV2640 camera

### ðŸ”§ Key Activities

* Upload sample servo sweep sketch
* Test camera using Wi-Fi stream viewer
* Discuss what each component does (servo, camera, board)

### ðŸ“š Vocabulary

* PWM (Pulse Width Modulation)
* GPIO (General Purpose Input/Output)
* ESP32 microcontroller

### ðŸ’¬ Discussion Prompt

"What does it mean for a robot to â€˜seeâ€™ something? What can it do with that information?"
