# üöÄ Mission Nova: Baseline Project Options (Lesson Plan Summary)

These three baseline options form the core of Mission Nova ‚Äî the starting point for all student groups at the DSAI 2025 camp. Each activity builds foundational understanding of sensors, control logic, and classification. All teams begin here before branching into advanced missions.

These three **project options** are **lightweight, accessible entry points** for students or teams with limited hardware or those who are newer to embedded AI systems. They fit neatly within our **Mission Nova** tier and are excellent stepping stones toward the more advanced **Mission Vega** and **Mission Orion** tracks.

## üß≠ Where These Options Fit

| Option     | Description                                         | Mission Level          | Purpose                                                                                         |
| ---------- | --------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| ‚úÖ Option 1 | Camera-Based Motion Detection using ESP32 or Webcam | **Nova**               | Introduces basic computer vision without physical movement. Helps students understand sensing.  |
| ‚úÖ Option 2 | Simulated Conveyor Using LEDs or Serial Output      | **Nova ‚Üí Vega Bridge** | Builds logic skills. Introduces routing and decision-making using state-based triggers.         |
| ‚úÖ Option 3 | Google Colab + OpenCV Motion Detection              | **Nova**               | Allows laptop-only teams to engage in visual detection logic. Great for teams with no hardware. |

## ‚úÖ Option A: Motion Classification with LEDs

**Core Concept:** Sensing + Displaying a State

### üß™ What Students Build:

* Use a sensor (e.g., PIR or basic camera logic)
* Detect a motion or object
* Display a message or status using LEDs

### üß∞ Materials:

* ESP32-S3 or Arduino-compatible board
* LED (single or RGB), resistor, jumper wires
* (Optional) PIR motion sensor or basic trigger input

### üìò Learning Objectives:

* Understand input-output flow
* Learn basic conditional logic (if motion ‚Üí turn on LED)
* Use breadboard and GPIO pins

### ‚è± Timing:

* 90 minutes (can be split into 2 sessions)

---

## ‚úÖ Option B: Servo Sorting Arm with Hardcoded Logic

**Core Concept:** Output Control + Simple Decision Tree

### üß™ What Students Build:

* Move a robot arm to fixed locations
* Use button or manual input to simulate classification
* Create a routine like: "Push Button ‚Üí Move to Position A"

### üß∞ Materials:

* ESP32-S3 + PCA9685 or direct PWM control
* Servo motor(s)
* Push button or simple input trigger
* Power supply (5V, shared ground)

### üìò Learning Objectives:

* Basic servo motor control
* Understanding motion via code
* Implementing repeatable actions with minimal logic

### ‚è± Timing:

* 90‚Äì120 minutes

---

## ‚úÖ Option C: Object Classification Simulation

**Core Concept:** AI Classification Without Model Training

### üß™ What Students Build:

* Simulate a classification event (color, shape, or size)
* Use pre-set classes like Food, Tool, Human
* Route to Deck A, B, or C using code and LED or terminal print

### üß∞ Materials:

* ESP32-S3 or laptop with serial interface
* Simulated input (e.g., predefined object types)
* (Optional) Manual toggle or button to switch inputs

### üìò Learning Objectives:

* Think like a classifier: map inputs to outputs
* Practice conditional and switch-case logic
* Prepare for more advanced model integration

### ‚è± Timing:

* 60‚Äì90 minutes

Each of these baseline options is designed to:

* Require minimal setup
* Provide immediate visual or mechanical feedback
* Prepare students to level up into Mission Vega (sensor fusion, reactive logic) or Mission Orion (multi-agent systems, planning, and feedback loops)
