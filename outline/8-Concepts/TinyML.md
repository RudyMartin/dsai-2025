What is TinyML?
“Neural networks are also called artificial neural networks (ANNs). The architecture forms the foundation of deep learning, which is merely a subset of machine learning concerned with algorithms that take inspiration from the structure and function of the human brain.  Put simply, neural networks form the basis of architectures that mimic how biological neurons signal to one another.”

Machine learning is a subfield of artificial intelligence that provides a set of algorithms. These algorithms allow machines to learn patterns and trends from available historical data to predict previously known outcomes on the same data. However, the main goal is to use the trained models to generalize their inferences beyond the training data set, improving the accuracy of their predictions without being explicitly programmed.

One such algorithm used for these tasks is neural networks. Neural networks belong to a subfield of machine learning known as deep learning, which consists of models that are typically more expensive to train than machine learning models. You can learn more about building neural network models in R in a separate tutorial.
