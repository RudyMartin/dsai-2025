Here’s a clear slide outline for the modeling process, tailored to the five main tasks you’ll likely encounter this week. This format follows standard machine learning workflows and is easy to adapt for different project types[1][4][3].

## **Modeling Process for This Week’s Five Main Tasks**

---

### **1. Define the Problem**
- Identify the question or prediction you want to answer.
- Example: "Can we predict which NFL player will be picked first?"

---

### **2. Data Preparation**
- **Collect Data:** Gather relevant datasets (player stats, team needs, etc.).
- **Pre-process Data:** Clean, handle missing values, normalize, and encode features as needed[1][3].
- **Split Data:** Divide into training, validation, and test sets[2][4].

---

### **3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
- Visualize data and explore key patterns or relationships.
- Identify important features and potential outliers[1].

---

### **4. Feature Engineering**
- Create new features or select the most relevant ones to improve model performance[1][3].
- Example: Combine player stats into a "prospect score."

---

### **5. Model Building & Evaluation**
- **Choose Model(s):** Select appropriate algorithms (e.g., logistic regression, decision trees, random forest)[1].
- **Train Model:** Fit the model on the training data.
- **Validate Model:** Tune parameters and check performance on the validation set.
- **Test Model:** Evaluate final model on the test set for unbiased performance[2][4].

---

### **6. Interpretation & Deployment**
- Interpret results and visualize predictions.
- (Optional) Deploy the model for real-world use or share findings with stakeholders[4].
