To determine the cost of buying just the items on the updated parts list for the LEGO Mindstorms Robot Inventor 51515 set (steps 1, 2, 4–60 of the Learning Brick Sorter Bird build), we need to consider the quantities of each part and their individual costs. The list currently includes a subset of the full set’s 949 pieces, as it only accounts for the parts used in the specified steps. Let’s break this down.
Step 1: Review the Parts List
Here’s the updated parts list with quantities from steps 1, 2, 4–60:
Baseplate 16x32 with Rounded Corners (64276): 1
Mindstorms Robot Inventor Hub (51515): 1
Technic Tank Tread (57518): 1
Mindstorms Color Sensor (45605): 1
Technic Pin with Friction Ridges (2780): 49
Technic Axle 5 (32073): 45
Technic Bush (3713): 32
Technic Axle Connector (32013): 1
Technic Axle 3 (4519): 29
Cable (45601): 1
Technic Frame 5x7 (64179): 5
Technic Axle 2 Notched (32062): 1
Technic Gear 20 Tooth (32198): 4
Technic Axle 4 (3705): 7
Technic Beam 1x3 (32523): 5
Technic Beam 1x7 (32524): 5
Technic Beam 1x5 (32316): 5
Medium Angular Motor (45603): 1
Technic Gear 12 Tooth (32270): 3
Total parts used in steps 1, 2, 4–60: 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 49 + 45 + 32 + 1 + 29 + 1 + 5 + 1 + 4 + 7 + 5 + 5 + 5 + 1 + 3 = 197 parts.
Step 2: Estimate the Cost
Unfortunately, I don’t have access to current (2025) pricing for individual LEGO parts. However, I can use historical data from sources like Brick Owl to estimate the cost. According to Brick Owl, the total cost of all 948 parts in the 51515 set in new condition is approximately $589.05 as of their last update (99% of items accounted for). This gives us a rough average cost per part:
Average cost per part: $589.05 ÷ 948 ≈ $0.621 per part.
For the 197 parts used in steps 1, 2, 4–60:
Estimated cost (using average): 197 × $0.621 ≈ $122.34.
Step 3: Adjust for Specific Parts
The average cost per part doesn’t account for the fact that some parts (like the Mindstorms Hub, Color Sensor, and Medium Angular Motor) are significantly more expensive than standard Technic pieces like pins or axles. Let’s break it down further with some assumptions based on typical LEGO part pricing trends:
Mindstorms Robot Inventor Hub (51515): This is a high-value electronic component. Historically, hubs like this can cost $100–$150 alone.
Mindstorms Color Sensor (45605): Sensors typically range from $20–$40.
Medium Angular Motor (45603): Motors are often $15–$30 each.
Cable (45601): Cables are usually $5–$10.
Baseplate 16x32 (64276): Large baseplates can be $5–$15.
Technic Tank Tread (57518): Specialty parts like this might be $5–$10.
For the remaining parts (pins, axles, bushes, beams, frames, gears), we can use the average cost of $0.621, as they are more standard Technic pieces.
Quantity of standard Technic parts:
Technic Pin with Friction Ridges (2780): 49
Technic Axle 5 (32073): 45
Technic Bush (3713): 32
Technic Axle Connector (32013): 1
Technic Axle 3 (4519): 29
Technic Frame 5x7 (64179): 5
Technic Axle 2 Notched (32062): 1
Technic Gear 20 Tooth (32198): 4
Technic Axle 4 (3705): 7
Technic Beam 1x3 (32523): 5
Technic Beam 1x7 (32524): 5
Technic Beam 1x5 (32316): 5
Technic Gear 12 Tooth (32270): 3
Total standard parts: 49 + 45 + 32 + 1 + 29 + 5 + 1 + 4 + 7 + 5 + 5 + 5 + 3 = 191 parts.
Cost of standard parts: 191 × $0.621 ≈ $118.61.
Estimated cost of specialized parts:
Hub: $125 (midpoint of $100–$150).
Color Sensor: $30 (midpoint of $20–$40).
Motor: $22.50 (midpoint of $15–$30).
Cable: $7.50 (midpoint of $5–$10).
Baseplate: $10 (midpoint of $5–$15).
Tank Tread: $7.50 (midpoint of $5–$10).
Total for specialized parts: $125 + $30 + $22.50 + $7.50 + $10 + $7.50 = $202.50.
Step 4: Total Estimated Cost
Adding the cost of standard and specialized parts:
Total cost: $118.61 (standard parts) + $202.50 (specialized parts) = $321.11.
Step 5: Consider Inflation and Market Changes
The Brick Owl data is not from 2025, and prices may have changed due to inflation, LEGO part market trends, or the set’s discontinuation (noted as retired in some sources). Assuming a modest inflation rate of 3% per year from 2020 to 2025 (5 years):
Inflation adjustment: $321.11 × (1.03)^5 ≈ $321.11 × 1.1593 ≈ $372.26.
Final Answer
The estimated cost of buying just the 197 parts used in steps 1, 2, 4–60 of the Learning Brick Sorter Bird build is approximately $372.26 in 2025, based on historical data adjusted for inflation. This estimate could vary depending on current market prices, availability, and whether you buy new or used parts. For a more accurate cost, you’d need to check current prices on marketplaces like Brick Owl, BrickLink, or ToyPro.
