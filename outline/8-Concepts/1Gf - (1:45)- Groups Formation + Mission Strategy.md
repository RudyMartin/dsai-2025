### 🧱 **Baseline Track – Mission Nova (Foundational Skills)**

These are your **starter missions**. All teams begin here.

| Option     | Name                          | Role         | Skills Introduced                          |
| ---------- | ----------------------------- | ------------ | ------------------------------------------ |
| ✅ Option 1 | Camera-Based Motion Detection | Nova Scout   | Computer vision basics, sensing            |
| ✅ Option 2 | Simulated Conveyor with LEDs  | Nova Logic   | Control logic, routing rules               |
| ✅ Option 3 | Google Colab Motion Detection | Nova Analyst | Visual AI interpretation, threshold tuning |

✅ **What Makes It Nova?**

* No motors or minimal hardware setup
* Emphasizes sensing, logic, and simulation
* Prepares students to “see and decide” before “move and coordinate”

### 🌌 **Intermediate Track – Mission Vega (Sensor-Aware Systems)**

Unlocked after Nova. Vega projects focus on **real-world inputs and physical reactions**.

| Agentic Extension                | Name             | Role                               | Key Focus |
| -------------------------------- | ---------------- | ---------------------------------- | --------- |
| 🛤️ Traffic Controller Agent     | Vega Control     | Flow management via belts, servos  |           |
| 🔁 Resource Allocation Agent     | Vega Commander   | Choosing arms or stations          |           |
| 🔆 Environmental Awareness Agent | Vega Sensor Lead | Temp/light-based routing decisions |           |

✅ **What Makes It Vega?**

* Includes servo control or conveyor motion
* Uses **at least one external sensor** (e.g., temp, light)
* Students integrate feedback loops into logic

### 🛰️ **Advanced Track – Mission Orion (Multi-Agent & Strategic Coordination)**

Final tier. Orion missions simulate **collaborative, intelligent systems**.

| Agentic Extension      | Name             | Role                                   | Intelligence Layer |
| ---------------------- | ---------------- | -------------------------------------- | ------------------ |
| 🧠 Goal-Seeking Agent  | Orion Strategist | Memory, goal optimization              |                    |
| 📡 Communication Agent | Orion Networker  | Multi-agent messaging                  |                    |
| 🧮 Routing Agent       | Orion Planner    | Complex decision logic, load balancing |                    |

✅ **What Makes It Orion?**

* Requires **communication between agents** (e.g., logging, signals)
* Must track goals or mission states over time
* Typically involves **distributed systems** (multi ESP32s, shared logs)
