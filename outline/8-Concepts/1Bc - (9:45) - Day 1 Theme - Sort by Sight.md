# DSAI 2025 - ARTEMIS Summer Camp


## üß≠ Day 1: Classification + Action ‚Äì "Sort by Sight"

### üéØ Mission Objective

Create a basic vision-to-action loop: detect object class, move to destination.

### üß† Learning Objectives

* Use image classification (color or shape detection)
* Implement simple `if/else` logic to move blocks
* Control robot arm position based on camera input

### üîß Key Activities

* Hard-code color detection thresholds (e.g., Red, Blue, Yellow)
* Assign fixed destinations (bins A/B/C)
* Move robot arm after classification

### üìö Vocabulary

* Inference
* Classification
* Logic gate (`if`, `else if`, `else`)

### üí¨ Discussion Prompt

"If the robot sees red, how do we tell it what to do? Can we trust its decision?"
