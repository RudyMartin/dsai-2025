### ✅ **MCP: Model–Context–Protocol** Core Loop

| **Step** | **Name**   | **What it Means** (Student-Friendly)                          | **Example**                          |
| -------- | ---------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| **1**    | **Sense**  | Gather data from sensors, input, or environment               | “What’s happening?”                  |
| **2**    | **Plan**   | Choose the next action based on the current state + input     | “What should I do now?”              |
| **3**    | **Act**    | Move a servo, show text, send a signal — take physical action | “Do it!”                             |
| **4**    | **Log**    | Record what happened (locally or to cloud/NAS/logs)           | “Write down what I did.”             |
| **5**    | **Repeat** | Return to sensing and continue the loop                       | “Keep going… next input, next plan…” |

This cycle **is the FSM mind loop**, just made *physical* in your robots or assistants.

### ✅ Teaching Tip:

You can let students *nickname* it:

> "**1-2-3-4-5 Loop**"
> "The Brain Loop"
> "How every good robot thinks"

> See - Think - Do - Speak - Loop

| **Word**  | **Maps To** | **Student Meaning**                                | **Real Example**                              |
| --------- | ----------- | -------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| **See**   | Sense       | “What did I observe?”                              | Camera sees a block, sensor reads temperature |
| **Think** | Plan        | “What should I do based on that?”                  | Decide to move, respond, or trigger a warning |
| **Do**    | Act         | “Take action!”                                     | Turn servo, light up LED, send signal         |
| **Speak** | Log         | “Let me tell someone (or record) what I just did.” | Print to serial, write to file, send message  |
| **Loop**  | Repeat      | “Start over and do it again.”                      | Return to ‘See’ for the next input            |
