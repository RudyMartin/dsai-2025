🧪 Example Missions Using Legos
✅ 1. Autonomous Object Identifier
Students create “mission supplies” with Lego bricks (different shapes/colors)

Train a detection model (with Roboflow) to classify them

ESP32 or Pi identifies objects in real-time → logs to NAS or dashboard

✅ 2. Lego Puzzle Crate
A box made of Lego bricks

Only opens if the correct object is presented (AI model + servo)

Alpha team: camera + ESP32; Beta team: camera + Pi

✅ 3. Smart Habitat
Build a Lego “moon base” with sensors inside

Track light, heat, motion

If something changes, the system logs it or alerts the command team
